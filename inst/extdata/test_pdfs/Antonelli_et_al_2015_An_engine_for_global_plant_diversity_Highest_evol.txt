Understanding the processes that have generated the latitudinal biodiversity gradient and
the continental differences in tropical biodiversity remains a major goal of evolutionary
biology. Here we estimate the timing and direction of range shifts of extant flowering
plants (angiosperms) between tropical and non-tropical zones, and into and out of the
major tropical regions of the world. We then calculate rates of speciation and extinction
taking into account incomplete taxonomic sampling. We use a recently published
fossil calibrated phylogeny and apply novel bioinformatic tools to code species into
user-defined polygons. We reconstruct biogeographic history using stochastic character
mapping to compute relative numbers of range shifts in proportion to the number of
available lineages through time. Our results, based on the analysis of c. 22,600 species
and c. 20 million geo-referenced occurrence records, show no significant differences
between the speciation and extinction of tropical and non-tropical angiosperms. This
suggests that at least in plants, the latitudinal biodiversity gradient primarily derives from
other factors than differential rates of diversification. In contrast, the outstanding species
richness found today in the American tropics (the Neotropics), as compared to tropical
Africa and tropical Asia, is associated with significantly higher speciation and extinction
rates. This suggests an exceedingly rapid evolutionary turnover, i.e., Neotropical species
being formed and replaced by one another at unparalleled rates. In addition, tropical
America stands out from other continents by having “pumped out” more species than it
received through most of the last 66 million years. These results imply that the Neotropics
have acted as an engine for global plant diversity.

Introduction
The world’s biodiversity is unevenly distributed, and most species are found in the tropical regions
of Asia (including Australasia), Africa, and the Americas. Understanding the underlying causes for
the latitudinal biodiversity gradient—the decrease of taxonomic diversity away from the equator—
has fostered extensive and integrative research, and its formation still constitutes a matter of debate

or were there phases of markedly different range shift rates
and directionality?
(2) Is high diversity correlated with high speciation and/or low
extinction?
More specifically, were there significant differences in speciation and extinction rates between tropical and non-tropical
zones, and among tropical regions? In such case, are the most
species rich regions also those with highest speciation and/or
lowest extinction?

in evolutionary biology and biogeography (see e.g., Pianka, 1966;
Hillebrand, 2004; Jablonski et al., 2006; Wiens et al., 2006; Brown,
2014; Huang et al., 2014; Kerkhoff et al., 2014; Mannion et al.,
2014; Rolland et al., 2014).
There are three primary explanations for the latitudinal biodiversity gradient, which are not mutually exclusive. Often referred
to as the museum hypothesis (Stebbins, 1974), one view is that
there has been a longer period of time for the accumulation of
diversity in the tropics because most of the Earth was essentially
tropical until the Eocene–Oligocene boundary c. 34 million of
years ago (Ma; Zachos et al., 2008). In contrast to the focus on
geological and evolutionary time, it has also been proposed that
higher tropical biodiversity could be caused by higher net diversification rates in tropical vs. temperate zones (Mittelbach et al.,
2007), i.e., either due to high speciation, low extinction, or some
combination of both. Why such rates would be different is in
itself a matter of further debate, with a key role being attributed
to kinetics (Brown, 2014). More recently it has been suggested
that it is the inability of tropical lineages to disperse, survive, and
diversify out of the tropics that drives the latitudinal biodiversity gradient, due to intrinsic eco-physiological constraints (niche
conservatism; Kerkhoff et al., 2014).
A second striking feature of tropical biodiversity, besides
being consistently higher than in non-tropical regions, is its
uneven distribution among the three tropical regions of the
world. For instance, it has been suggested that the American tropics (the Neotropics) comprise more species of seed
plants than tropical Africa and tropical Asia together, with similar patterns for other organismal groups such as amphibians,
mammals, birds, nymphalid butterflies, and reptiles (Govaerts,
2001; Antonelli, 2008; Antonelli and Sanmartín, 2011 and references therein). The underlying causes for these inter-continental
differences are poorly understood, and could be analogous to
those determining the latitudinal biodiversity gradient. In addition, differences in area and biome sizes, environmental and soil
heterogeneity, climatic history, biological exploration, and digitalization of natural history collections (amongst others) could
also play important roles.
Evaluating the validity and relative roles of the factors driving
these fundamental biodiversity differences requires combining
evidence from several sources and disciplines, such as palaeontology, ecology and molecular phylogenetics. Among these, two
main components stand out as essential in this pursuit: understanding species diversification (i.e., the interplay between speciation and extinction) and the geographic history of lineages.
In this study we explore these two components at a global and
continental scale. We focus on the Cenozoic history (i.e., the last
66 Ma) of flowering plants (angiosperms), which form the dominant structure of tropical and temperate ecosystems. We ask two
overarching questions:

To address these questions, we calculate and compare rates
of speciation and extinction between tropical and non-tropical
zones and among the world’s three tropical regions (in Africa,
Asia, and the Americas), and we infer the timing and direction
of range shifts into and out of each tropical region.

Material and Methods
Data Compilation
Fossils, molecular phylogenies, and species occurrences constitute diverse data sources that, taken together, can be used to infer
diversity trends through time and space. Here we explore the feasibility of using both neontological and palaeontological data for
addressing the questions outlined in this study.

Fossils
We explored whether fossils could be used to infer diversity
trends through time, as has been recently demonstrated for fossil rich clades such as mammals (Silvestro et al., 2014). For
this we assessed a global data set of angiosperm macrofossil occurrences originally downloaded from the Paleobiology
database (https://www.paleobiodb.org) as described by Silvestro
et al. (2015). The data set included 9,665 records, representing
a total of 297 fossil taxa identified to the genus level; identifications below the generic level were grouped by genus. To investigate potential biases in the data, all records were subdivided by
country and time period (from the Lower Cretaceous to today),
according to the Geological Time Scale of Gradstein et al. (2012).
Unfortunately, a visual inspection of the data (Figure 1) showed
severe spatial and temporal biases. These biases precluded any
sensible analyses of diversity changes in tropical regions, and
we were therefore forced to rely on species distribution and
molecular data alone.

Species Occurrences
We downloaded all geo-referenced (i.e., provided with a longitude and latitude) species occurrences of angiosperms available at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF,
http://www.gbif.org; downloaded in June 2014). Records flagged
to contain “known coordinate issues” were excluded prior to the
download. One record per location per species was retained. We
then applied basic data cleaning steps on the full data set (c. 40
gigabytes) for identifying and excluding obviously erroneous data
points, such as records with non-numeric coordinates or missing species names, records with identical latitude and longitude,
and latitudes or longitudes equal to zero (which we considered
to have been left in blank during data entry). For these steps

(1) Have the tropics as a whole, and each tropical region separately, been mainly a sink or a source of angiosperm diversity?
More specifically, did range shifts (including trans-oceanic
dispersals) between tropical and non-tropical zones, and
into and out of each tropical region, occur in both directions at a roughly constant pace throughout the Cenozoic,

areas (such as the Sahara in Africa, the Caatinga in South America and parts of the Deccan plateau in India) as well as the coldest
habitats (e.g., high altitude areas in the South American Andes
and along the African Great Rift Valley) located within the tropical belt (between c. 23◦ north and c. 23◦ south). Although smaller
operational units would have been interesting from a biological
perspective, e.g., separating rain forests and savannas, it would
inevitably incur a considerable loss of data and statistical power
for the subsequent analyses. We utilized the software package
SpeciesGeoCoder v.1.0 (Töpel et al., 2014) to code species into
operational units. The resulting polygons can be retrieved from
the authors upon request.
To further identify potential biases caused by erroneous georeferences (e.g., due to wrong coordinates or species identifications), we applied a set of arbitrary thresholds in order for a
species to be coded as “present” in a certain operational unit.
Three filters were defined, with increasingly more strict criteria,
as outlined in Table 1. We implemented functions and scripts
to carry out this data filtering in R (scripts available from the
authors).
There was no major loss of occurrence records by going from
Filter 1 to the more conservative Filter 2 (see Results below). We
therefore chose to perform our analyses on range transitions on
the data set generated under Filter 2, and the diversification rate
analyses using the Filter 3 data set, due to the fact that the method
we employed cannot handle widespread taxa (see below).

we used a modified version of the scripts by Zanne et al. (2014)
implemented in R (R Core Team, 2014).

Geographic Assignments
We coded each species for its presence and absence in four
large regions or operational units (Figure 2): tropical America
(the Neotropics), tropical Africa (the Afrotropics), tropical Asia
(including Australasia), and all other (non-tropical) regions combined. We delimited those regions by following the same boundaries for biomes and ecoregions as adopted by the World Wide
Fund for Nature (WWF), as described in Olson et al. (2001). We
considered the following ecoregions as forming together the tropical region: “Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests,”
“Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf Forests,” “Tropical and
Subtropical Coniferous Forests” and “Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands, Savannas, and Shrublands.” All other ecoregions
were merged to form our “non-tropical” region. We classified
“Flooded Grasslands and Shrublands” as tropical or non-tropical
depending on the surrounding biome and geographic position.
We acknowledge that the WWF biome and ecoregion classification is to some extent arbitrary and based on expert opinion,
rather than directly data derived (Vilhena and Antonelli, 2014).
However, we consider that the level of accuracy of this classification is adequate for the purposes of this study, and superior to a
classification based solely on latitudinal limits or a purely climatic
classification without proper consideration of biotic components
(Kottek et al., 2006).
For each continent, all polygons for biomes classified as “tropical” were merged into a single polygon, and the same was done
for all “non-tropical” biomes, which were merged into a single
multi-polygon comprising areas in both the southern and the
northern hemisphere. This means that each tropical region comprised e.g., both rainforests and savannas, but excluded very dry

Molecular Phylogeny
We chose to work with a single dated tree rather than performing a meta-analysis of individual trees (e.g., Jansson et al., 2013,
so that divergence times among clades would be more directly
comparable with each other. We therefore used the recent
fossil-calibrated molecular phylogeny of angiosperms from

number of species in the diversification analyses classified as tropical divided by the total

in the diversification analyses classified as outside the tropics divided by the total number

We tested whether species in each of the regions defined
(Figure 2) were clustered in the angiosperm phylogeny (i.e.,
showed strong phylogenetic signal) using Bayesian TipSignificance testing implemented in the software BaTS v. 1.0
(Parker et al., 2008). We compared the observed distribution
of states in the reference phylogeny against 100 randomized
replicates, which were used to compute 95% credible intervals of
trait distributions.

Range Shifts through Time

Diversification Rates

We used the region-coded, dated phylogeny of angiosperms to
estimate the timing and directionality of range shifts between
tropical and non-tropical lineages, and among the three tropical
regions of the world. Since our analyses focused on the Cenozoic, when the three tropical continents were already widely separated by oceans (Mcloughlin, 2001), these events should include
both trans-oceanic dispersals as well as range expansions over
continuous land between the tropical and non-tropical zone.
We used stochastic character mapping (Huelsenbeck et al.,
2003) to reconstruct histories of shifts across biogeographic
regions (e.g., Clark et al., 2008). We calculated the relative
number of transitions through time (Silvestro, 2012; FernándezMendoza and Printzen, 2013) as the absolute number of transitions divided by the number of nodes in 5 million year time
bins. We did this to account for the fact that even under a simple birth model of speciation the number of lineages in a phylogeny tends to increase exponentially, therefore increasing the
possibility of range shifts to occur toward the present (Silvestro,
2012). Credible intervals around the relative number of transitions through time were obtained by simulating 100 stochastic
histories of geographic range evolution. We optimized the original scripts implementing this method and implemented them in

We calculated rates of speciation (λ) and extinction (µ) for each
tropical region separately, as well as for tropical and non-tropical
species. For these analyses we used the Multiple State Speciation
and Extinction method (MuSSE) as implemented in diversitree
(Fitzjohn, 2012). We analyzed 17 subclades separately (Table 2),
which we chose to correspond to plant orders. This division was
necessary due to computational limitations in analysing the full
tree under this method, but also carried the advantage of creating a sample of rate estimates across different angiosperm clades.
We did not explore the effect of splitting the angiosperm tree into
different numbers of subclades or along different branches, since
there would be an almost endless number of possible combinations. We accounted for varying levels of taxonomic sampling in
the phylogeny by calculating the sampling fraction of each order.
We compared the significance of results from the diversification analyses using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and then
applied the Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD) test in
order to identify outstanding values. To account for intrinsic
differences among plant orders, we normalized the rates of speciation and extinction for each order over all regions. This was
done by dividing each rate by the sum of the rates in all regions
analyzed. In all analyses, we used mean values of rates.

(e.g., synonymisation and different taxonomic circumscriptions),
and the fact that numerous species did not occur in both data
sets. Despite these issues, a total of 27,585 species could be fully
matched between the molecular phylogeny and the occurrence
data set, representing 14.6% of the total number of currently
accepted species of angiosperms (273,174 species, according to
http://www.theplantlist.org; accessed September 2014). The data
set generated under Filter 2, used for all analyses except MuSSE
and BaTS, comprised a total of c. 20 million occurrence points
and between c. 500 to 6600 species per region (Figure 3).

Biogeography and diversification of tropical angiosperms

Discussion

(Table 3). All tropical regions were similarly represented in the
phylogeny, with only 2% difference between the best sampled
tropical region (tropical Asia) and the least sampled one (tropical
America). Non-tropical regions were better sampled phylogenetically than tropical ones (15% vs. 9%, respectively).

The Geographic History of Tropical Angiosperms
Our analyses of historical range shift events (Figure 5) reveal
some interesting patterns. During the first half of the Cenozoic (from 66 until c. 30 Ma), our results indicate that most
range shifts took place out of the tropics. This result corroborates a recent meta-analysis of 111 dated phylogenies, including seven clades of angiosperms (Jansson et al., 2013), and
also reflects the directionality observed from the fossil record
of marine bivalves for the last 11 Ma (Jablonski et al., 2006,

Phylogeny-based Analyses
Figure 4A shows the angiosperm phylogeny and the coding of
each species as occurring in each of the four regions defined,
whereas Figure 4B shows the coding in tropical and non-tropical
regions. The Bayesian Tip-Significance testing indicated that
species in all regions (Figure 2) are highly clustered phylogenetically (p < 0.001 for all three statistical tests implemented in
BaTS: parsimony score, association index and maximum exclusive single-state clade).
The results from the range shift analyses are summarized in
Figure 5. Confidence intervals of range shift rates were generally large and mostly overlapping, but the width of their ranges
decreased toward the present. During most of the Cenozoic,
mean emigration rates (out of the tropics) were slightly higher
or very similar to migration into the tropics (Figure 5A). From
c. 58 to c. 44 Ma, immigration into the tropics showed a small
decrease. Both tropical Africa (Figure 5B) and tropical Asia
(Figure 5C) showed similar mean rates of immigration and emigration through time, except for some fluctuations (especially in
Asia, prior to c. 25 Ma). In contrast, there was a consistently
higher rate of emigration from tropical America (Figure 5D).
These rates only reached equilibrium c. 14 Ma.
The region-specific rates of speciation and extinction inferred
using the MuSSE model are shown in Figure 6, calculated under
the sampling fractions for each order indicated in Table 2. Individual estimates are reported in Supplementary Table S1, and
significance values in each set of comparisons are summarized
in Table 4.
The median values of both speciation and extinction rates
were higher in non-tropical than in tropical zones, but these estimates showed large overlap in their confidence intervals and are
not statistically different (Figures 6A,B). In contrast, both the
speciation and the extinction rates estimated for tropical America
were significantly higher than those estimates for tropical Africa
and tropical Asia (Figures 6C,D, p < 0.05 for speciation, and
p < 0.001 for extinction).

rate estimations for tropical Africa, Asia, and America, respectively. The 95%

system in Southeast Asia c. 35–20 Ma (Favre et al., 2014).
The “out-of-India” hypothesis postulates that a number of
African-derived organisms, including both animals (Bossuyt and
Milinkovitch, 2001) and plants (Conti et al., 2002), rafted on the
Indian subcontinent and dispersed into Asia after the collision of
these landmasses. This dispersal route has received support from
the molecular analyses of several taxa (Karanth, 2006). We note a
temporal correlation between the initial collision (c. 55 Ma) and
the shift from tropical Asia being mainly a sink of lineages to it
becoming a net source of angiosperm diversity. Another major
event in the Cenozoic is the geological rejuxtaposition of Southeast Asia, which created a stepping-stone route between Oceania
and Asia from c. 40 Ma (Hall, 2009). This event might be reflected
in our results by the increase of lineages entering tropical Asia
around that time, leading again to a net input of non-tropical
lineages into tropical Asia.
Range shifts out of tropical America were consistently more
frequent that those entering it, throughout most of the Cenozoic (from c. 65 to 15 Ma; Figure 6D). A remarkable peak in
emigration shifts was estimated at c. 57 Ma, which was simultaneously associated with a modest decrease in immigration events.
These results imply a c. 3 times higher rate of lineages leaving the
Neotropics than shifts in the opposite direction. We note that this
peak corresponds closely in time (allowing for the uncertainties
in molecular dating) to the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; Figure 5A). This was a short-lived (c. 10,000 years)

2013), Overall, range shifts appear poorly associated in time
with climate, approximated through a mean global temperature
curve (Figure 5A). Some correspondence may however include
a c. 30% decrease in range shifts into the world’s tropics during the highest temperature levels of the Cenozoic, around the
Early Eocene Climatic Optimum c. 52 Ma (Zachos et al., 2008).
An additional overall decrease is observed coinciding with the
Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum c. 15 Ma. Why global warming would have influenced range shifts among tropical and nontropical regions as observed here is puzzling, and may reflect
large-scale but poorly understood vegetational changes. We also
note that range shifts into and out of the tropics reached an
equilibrium only a few million years after the Eocene-Oligocene
transition, a global cooling event associated with the gradual
glaciation of Antarctica (Zachos et al., 2008).
Range shifts into and out of tropical Africa (Figure 5B)
occurred in both directions at about the same rate, and showed
the least fluctuations among the three tropical regions analyzed. The initial formation of the Sahara c. 7 Ma (Zhang et al.,
2014) did not seem to leave a considerable footprint on these
rates.
Range shifts into and out of tropical Asia (Figure 5C) were
fairly similar and exhibited most fluctuations prior to c. 23
Ma. Major events in that period include the collision of India
with Asia c. 55–45 Ma, the uplift of the Qianghai-Tibetan
Plateau c. 45–20 Ma, and the establishment of the monsoon

event which took place c. 56.3 Ma and was characterized by
mean global temperatures reaching above 12◦ C from today’s level
(Zachos et al., 2008). Evidence from the fossil record show that
considerable changes occurred at the PETM in Neotropical rainforests, with rapid origination of new taxa and changes in vegetation composition due to range shifts and local extirpations
(Jaramillo et al., 2010). It seems therefore reasonable to suggest

Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org

that newly speciated taxa might, at least in part, account for the
inferred peak.
The high rate of range shifts out of the Neotropics is particularly noteworthy in comparison to the other tropical regions,
where we did not find this difference between immigration and
emigration. Thus, our results suggest that the Neotropics have
functioned as a “species pump” for the rest of the world during

Biogeography and diversification of tropical angiosperms

(Richardson et al., 2001; Erkens et al., 2007). Diversification in the
region has been linked to the substantial changes in the landscape
in the Neogene (Hoorn et al., 2010; Wesselingh et al., 2010), but
several taxa may have an even younger origin in the Quaternary
(Rull, 2011; Smith et al., 2014).

the first 50 million years of the Cenozoic, but in particular during
the Paleocene and early Eocene. The reasons for this require further investigation, but reflect the patterns observed in marine
bivalves in which clades with higher diversification were the most
likely to expand out of the tropics (Jablonski et al., 2013).
A second event of potential significance for range shifts in the
Neotropics was the establishment of a stepping-stone land bridge
reducing the gap between North and South America, known as
the Greater Antilles and Aves Ridge or GAARlandia (IturraldeVinent and Macphee, 1999; Pennington and Dick, 2004). The
existence and role of the GAARlandia in facilitating dispersals
remains controversial (Ali, 2012), but the hypothesis has gained
recent support in phylogeographic analyses of several animal
taxa, including spiders (Crews and Gillespie, 2010), amphibians
(Alonso et al., 2012) and cichlids (Říčan et al., 2013). We did not
detect any definite signal of the GAARlandia in our estimation of
range shifts for angiosperms, except perhaps for a slow decrease
in shifts entering the Neotropics (which, if confirmed, could also
be linked to the global temperature decline at Eocene/Oligocene
transition).

Reliability of Results: Pushing the limits of
Biological Data
Evolutionary biology and biogeography are now experiencing a tremendous accumulation of data, including molecular
sequences, fossils, and species occurrences, with a hitherto unrealized scientific potential. An emerging question, however, is to
what extent available data and methods are sufficient to provide us with reliable answers to some of the most fundamental
questions in biology. A critical evaluation of the data, methods
and assumptions is therefore crucial but often underestimated in
evolutionary studies.
Whenever possible, palaeontological data should be studied in
conjunction with molecular-based evolutionary analyses (Quental and Marshall, 2010; Fritz et al., 2013; Silvestro et al., 2014).
However, our assessment of angiosperm fossils currently available (Figure 1) suggests that data unavailability is a serious issue
for angiosperms. The number of angiosperm fossil occurrences
publicly available varied considerably among countries and geological periods, with some countries (e.g., USA, Russia) and periods (e.g., the Miocene) being considerably better represented
than others. On a continental scale, lack of data is particularly
critical for Africa, Southeast Asia and Australasia; but even within
relatively well-sampled continents (such as Europe and South
America) there are strong regional biases among countries.
Similar to the case of fossil data, there is general skepticism concerning the use of publicly available species occurrences
for understanding species distributions, especially from nonverified databases such as GBIF. Distribution data have been
shown to contain important taxonomic, temporal and spatial
biases (Boakes et al., 2010). The question of whether bioinformatic tools may correctly infer biodiversity patterns despite those
biases remains largely unanswered, and will also depend on the
scale and taxa in focus—with higher accuracy expected for wellstudied taxa and large spatial units. Recent studies suggest that
automated data handling procedures are able to yield biologically realistic results, if enough care and appropriate techniques
are employed (Zanne et al., 2014; Engemann et al., 2015; Maldonado et al., accepted). In other cases, the manual validation by
taxonomists appears crucial, e.g., for the assessment of species’
conservation status for the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species
(Hjarding et al., 2014).
Our approach of automatically coding species into regions
and calculating sampling fractions using GBIF data and polygons is not intended to replace the time-consuming work
by taxonomists. However, it constitutes an additional, dataderived and spatially explicit approach that deserves further
exploration and validation. Estimating global and regional patterns of species richness and biodiversity remains a notoriously
difficult and contentious topic, with no consensus reached (Govaerts, 2001; Crane, 2004; Ungricht, 2004; Wortley and Scotland, 2004; Chapman, 2009; Mora et al., 2011). In addition,

Building up Tropical Biodiversity
Our phylogeny-based estimates of speciation and extinction rates
(Figure 6) showed that angiosperms in tropical regions both
speciated and went extinct at lower rates than in temperate
regions, although this difference was not significant (p > 0.05;
Table 4). This result reflects the lack of conclusive evidence on
this issue. Several studies have suggested higher rates of diversification (defined as speciation minus extinction) in the tropics (Mittelbach et al., 2007), including amphibians (Pyron and
Wiens, 2013), mammals (Rolland et al., 2014), and squamate reptiles (Pyron, 2014). Others have found temperate regions to have
higher diversification rates, based on the analysis of birds and
mammals (e.g., Weir and Schluter, 2007). An analysis of bird
diversification showed yet a third pattern, where the major differences in diversification rates were between the western and
eastern hemispheres, rather than between tropical and temperate zones (Jetz et al., 2012). Our results are similar to those
obtained by Jansson et al. (2013), who found no significant differences in the net diversification between tropical and temperate
sister lineages. Overall, our results suggest that the higher diversity of angiosperms in tropical compared to non-tropical regions
is not primarily dependent on higher speciation and/or lower
extinction in the tropics.
In contrast, our results show significantly different rates of
speciation and extinction amongst the tropical regions of the
world (Figures 6C,D). Neotropical angiosperms speciated on
average about 2–2.5 times faster than angiosperms in tropical
Asia and tropical Africa. However, they also went extinct about
2–2.5 times faster than in tropical Asia. These high rates of speciation and extinction in the Neotropics indicate a rapid evolutionary turnover, i.e., species being formed and replacing each other
at an unparalleled rate. This result is also in accordance to the
observation that South American plant diversity is characterized
by a relatively large number of recent, species-rich radiations,
for instance in the tropical Andes (Hughes and Eastwood, 2006;
Drummond et al., 2012; Madriñán et al., 2013) and Amazonia

Biogeography and diversification of tropical angiosperms

Future Prospects: More Data, Improved Methods

there is no general agreement on how to best define, delimit
and name biogeographical regions (Kreft and Jetz, 2010; Holt
et al., 2013; Vilhena and Antonelli, 2014), with the implication for this study that the world’s three tropical regions are
differently circumscribed in the literature. Our study suggests
that a relatively stable assignment of species to large regions (as
in Figure 2) may be attained through simple, automated filtering steps, in which the addition of increasingly restrictive criteria for coding species results in relatively small differences
(Figure 3).
The reconstruction of ancestral character states (such as morphology and geographic distribution) along phylogenies is now
common practice in evolutionary studies, but only make sense
when the traits analyzed are phylogenetically structured—i.e.,
they are not randomly distributed across the tree. Since we found
highly significant clustering of species pertaining to the same
geographic assignment in each of the regions defined (Figure 4),
we consider that the geographic coding and reconstruction analyses using stochastic mapping are suitable for the goals of
this study.
The low taxonomic sampling in the phylogeny (Tables 2, 3)
may influence the calculation of range shifts. However, two considerations suggest that this influence is unlikely to significantly
affect the general patterns obtained. First, taxonomic sampling
varied by only 2% or less among the tropical continents. Second,
even at low sampling it should be possible to recover a relatively large proportion of range shifts among the regions outlined.
This is because biological sampling is far from being random,
with an over-representation of deep nodes that reflect morphological and geographical variations in taxa (Hohna et al., 2011;
ter Steege et al., 2011; Cusimano et al., 2012). In other words,
even if only a couple of species were sampled from a speciesrich but strictly African clade, our analyses should be able to
detect when that clade arrived in Africa. Further simulations
would be helpful to assess at which sampling levels the calculation of continental-level range shifts stabilize and become fully
reliable.
Diversification rates of angiosperms have varied widely among
clades (Magallón and Sanderson, 2001) and through time (Silvestro et al., 2015). Inferring the dynamics between speciation and
extinction through the Cenozoic for each continent should therefore provide important insights into the evolution of their floras.
However, the taxonomic sampling in the angiosperm phylogeny
was at or below 10% for all tropical regions (Figure 3, Table 3).
Sampling levels already below c. 80% are bound to flaw diversification rate estimates under current methods, often showing
slowdowns in net diversification that represent methodological
artifacts (Cusimano and Renner, 2010). Expectations on how the
missing species are distributed in a phylogeny depending on the
sampling scheme may increase the accuracy of diversification
analyses (Stadler and Bokma, 2013). However, no method has
been developed so far that is capable of confidently dealing with
the level of taxonomic sampling observed in the angiosperm phylogeny we used. The MuSSE analyses carried out here can only
provide point estimates for the orders surveyed, but should constitute a more powerful approach given the relatively large size of
the phylogeny utilized.

Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org

The inevitable incompleteness of the fossil record represents a
limit to macro-evolutionary analyses that can be carried out
using currently available data. However, the development of
new methods has shown that even incomplete fossil data can
provide essential information in estimating trends of phenotypic
evolution (Slater and Harmon, 2013) and species diversification
dynamics (Silvestro et al., 2014). Such models should be ideally
extended to historical biogeography and might shed new light on
the dynamics of migration of lineages through time and among
regions. In particular, fossils provide an important resource for
improving biogeographic reconstructions, as they provide information on past species ranges and may therefore further refine
or validate ancestral range analyses as performed here (Ronquist et al., 2012; Wood et al., 2013; Lawing and Matzke, 2014).
Although correct fossil placement on phylogenies can be problematic, their potential in this area is still insufficiently explored
(Wood et al., 2013).
Phylogeny-based diversification analyses are powerful complements to palaeontological inferences. However, they still
require further development to be confidently used with poorly
sampled phylogenies—as is often the case in plants, regardless
of geographic region (Figure 3 and Table 3). Until sampling
improves to a much higher level (both taxonomically and genetically), or methods currently used successfully with e.g., mammals
(Morlon et al., 2011; Stadler, 2011) are adapted and validated for
plants, we remain with limited power to assess the dynamics of
diversification rates through time and across clades.

Conclusions
Here we have shown that currently available biological data—
including species occurrences and dated phylogenetic trees—
hold the potential of providing novel and important insights into
large-scale patterns of species diversification and biogeography.
The geographic history of angiosperms involved a large number of range transitions between tropical and non-tropical zones,
as well as into and out of the world’s three tropical regions. Global
climatic changes and major geological events are likely to have
influenced some of the observed changes in range shifts, such
as the early Eocene climatic conditions and the large geographic
reconfigurations in tropical Asia (outlined in Figures 5A,C).
However, these are temporal correlations that require further validation. We cannot rule out that some of the fluctuations we
observed in the mean rates of range shifts reflect instead the
stochastic nature of dispersals and biome shifts, and/or from lack
of phylogenetic signal for events that happened tens of millions
of years ago.
No significant differences could be found between the speciation and extinction of tropical and non-tropical angiosperms.
This result reflects the lack of conclusive evidence on global diversification patterns for different organism groups. Although diversification estimates need to be continuously revalidated with the
addition of more genetic and taxonomic data and increasingly
robust methods, our results suggest that the latitudinal diversity gradient in angiosperms is not primarily caused by differences in speciation or extinction rates. Longer time for speciation

and tropical niche conservatism might therefore constitute better
models for explaining tropical angiosperm diversity.
Continental differences in tropical angiosperm diversity show
clearer patterns, adding to our knowledge on the global patterns
of plant diversity (Kier et al., 2005; Barthlott et al., 2007; Kreft and
Jetz, 2007; Kreft et al., 2010; Mutke et al., 2011). The outstanding
species richness of angiosperms found today in the Neotropics
as compared to tropical Africa and tropical Asia is associated
with significantly higher speciation and extinction rates in the
Neotropics (Figures 6C,D)—and thereby higher species turnover
and shorter average longevity of species. The causes underlying
these differences remain elusive, but might be associated with the
substantial landscape dynamics that have affected northern South
America since the Miocene, among other continent-specific differences such as biome sizes, niche space, and climatic history.
Our results also show that Neotropical diversity, once generated
in situ, was to a large extent “pumped out” of the Neotropics
(Figure 5D).
