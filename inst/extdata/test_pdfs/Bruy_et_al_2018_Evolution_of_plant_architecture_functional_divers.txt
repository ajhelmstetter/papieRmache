The diversification of ecological roles and related adaptations in closely related species
within a lineage is one of the most important processes linking plant evolution and
ecology. Plant architecture offers a robust framework to study these processes as
it can highlight how plant structure influences plant diversification and ecological
strategies. We investigated a case of gradual evolution of branching architecture in
Atractocarpus spp. (Rubiaceae), forming a monophyletic group in New Caledonia
that has diversified rapidly, predominantly in rainforest understory habitats. We used
a transdisciplinary approach to depict architectural variations and revealed multiple
evolutionary transitions from a branched (Stone’s architectural model) to a monocaulous
habit (Corner’s architectural model), which involved the functional reduction of branches
into inflorescences. We propose an integrative functional index that assesses branching
incidence on functional traits influencing both assimilation and exploration functions.
We showed that architectural transitions correlate with ecologically important functional
traits. Variation in ecologically important traits among closely relatives, as supported by
the architectural analysis, is suggestive of intense competition that favored divergence
among locally coexisting species. We propose that Pleistocene climatic fluctuations
causing expansion and contraction of rainforest could also have offered ecological
opportunities for colonizers in addition to the process of divergent evolution.

INTRODUCTION
Convergent and divergent evolution are widely recognized as important drivers of plant
diversification at large scale (Givnish and Sytsma, 1997; Gianoli, 2004; Drummond et al., 2012;
Couvreur et al., 2015; Givnish, 2016). Well known examples of large scale convergence in plants
(i.e., the appearance of phenotypic similarities among distantly related taxa) include the evolution
of a cushion growth habit in alpine environments (Boucher et al., 2012, 2016; Aubert et al.,
2014), rosette-shrubs in islands (Carlquist, 1974; Givnish, 2010; Lens et al., 2013), climbing

Evolution of Plant Architecture in Atractocarpus

Despite the functional importance of plant architectural
traits, little is known about their evolution (Kurmann and
Hemsley, 1999; León Enriquez et al., 2008). In a recent
review, Chomicki et al. (2017) investigated the evolution of
plant architecture for several groups. Their results showed
preferential transitions between models, suggesting pre-requisite
morphological ability for the evolution of a given plant
architecture. In contrast, some model transitions seem never
to occur, suggesting that genetic constraints might prevent
them. Chomicki et al. (2017) did not, however, investigate
processes involved in plant architectural evolution. Bateman
(Bateman and DiMichele, 1994; Bateman, 1999) argued that
the changes involved in the transition from one architecture
to another are too important and deep for such transitions
to take place gradually. Rather, such evolution is suggested
to occur preferentially by saltation, which involves the direct
shift from one competitive architecture to another without
passing through intermediate states associated with lower fitness.
Other authors have proposed the notion of an “architectural
continuum” (Oldeman, 1974; Barthélémy et al., 1989), suggesting
a continuous transition from one model to another in some
groups (Hallé et al., 1978). In the context of this diversity
of possible models to explain evolution in plant architecture,
detailed studies within individual clades that combine results
from molecular phylogenetic work with detailed architectural
analysis may be particularly informative.
Atractocarpus Schltr. & K. Krause (Gardenieae, Rubiaceae),
a Pacific genus of about 40 species, of which 32 are endemics
to New Caledonia (Mouly et al., under review), is ideally
suited to study the evolution of plant architecture and to
test hypotheses regarding the role of architecture in plant
ecological diversification. Especially since a recently published
phylogeny based on comprehensive sampling is available for
the genus (Mouly et al., under review). Most members
of this genus are treelets occurring in the understory of
tropical and subtropical rainforests, and they exhibit substantial
variation in branching pattern (Tirvengadum and Sastre,
1979; Robbrecht and Puff, 1986), ranging from monocaulous
(i.e., unbranched) to well-branched species, including various
intermediate states (Figure 1). The New Caledonia members
of Atractocarpus, which originated from a single colonization
event that occurred ca. 2.4 Myr ago (Mouly et al., under
review), has the highest diversification rate of any genus
studied to date (1.17 species species−1 Myr−1 ), approaching
that of the well-known Hawaiian lobelioid genus Cyanea on the
island of Maui (1.36 species species−1 Myr−1 , Givnish et al.,
2009).
The presence of a high diversification rate combined with
architectural diversity is thought to provide an indication of
ecological diversification, a situation that is often associated with
island colonization (Silvertown, 2004; Silvertown et al., 2005).
In groups adapted to growing in the forest understory, light is
a variable and limiting resource, and in response, plants have
deployed various growth strategies related to leaf photosynthesis
and the economization of carbon. To quantify the architectural
gradient from monocaulous (unbranched) to well-branched
species, we developed a new “functional branching index,”

mechanisms in lianas (Sousa-Baena et al., 2014, 2018), and
succulence in arid environments (Ogburn and Edwards, 2010;
Arakaki et al., 2011). These and others examples demonstrate that
similar habitats or micro-habitats can produce selective pressures
that favor some morphological and physiological traits. Another
evolutionary process, sometimes linked with convergence, is the
diversification of ecological roles among closely related species,
i.e., divergent evolution, which results in the exploitation of
different ecological resources (e.g., Bramwell, 1975; Givnish
et al., 2009, 2014). Convergent and divergent evolution have
been attributed to morpho-physiological traits, whose gradual
evolution or rapid innovation can lead to adaptive radiation,
sometimes involving increased diversification rates (Givnish and
Sytsma, 1997; Givnish et al., 2014; Couvreur et al., 2015). A
striking feature of convergent and divergent evolution is that it
often involves variation in growth habit, which represents the
ultimate form of a plant expressed in its physiognomy (Warming,
1909). Growth habit results from the integration of a set of
traits, e.g., branching pattern and structure, body size and shape,
position of inflorescences, and anatomy, among others, which
have generally been studied independently (e.g., Carlquist, 1984;
Rowe and Speck, 2005; Givnish et al., 2009; Isnard et al., 2012;
Wagner et al., 2014). Few work has, however, used the integrative
approach provided by plant architecture to study the evolution of
plant growth habit.
Plant architecture characterizes the spatial arrangement and
specialization of structures (morphological origin, branching
pattern, axis categorization) and their evolution during ontogeny
(Hallé et al., 1978; Barthélémy and Caraglio, 2007). As such, it
can highlight how plant structure impacts plant diversification
and can help identify evolutionary processes underlying plant
evolution (Bateman, 1994, 1999; Sussex and Kerk, 2001; MeyerBerthaud et al., 2010). Architectural studies have shown that
plants are modular organisms comprising elements that can
differ in their organization and functions (Hallé et al., 1978;
Barthélémy and Caraglio, 2007). For instance, in many tree and
treelet species, the trunk functions primarily for exploration and
to provide support, while branches are involved in assimilation
and reproduction. Plant architecture thus influences spatial
and temporal exploitation of resources (Smith et al., 2014).
Some architectural traits have been shown to impact plant
fitness, either directly (Küppers, 1989; Millet et al., 1999;
Charles-Dominique et al., 2010, 2012, 2017; Millan, 2016) or
in interaction with other functional traits (Pérez-Harguindeguy
et al., 2013; Trueba et al., 2016). Among the best known
examples are Corner’s rules, which stipulate that “the greater
the ramification, the smaller become the branches and their
appendages” (leaves, flowers, and fruits, Corner, 1949). This
statement points toward an effect of plant architecture on
leaf size and linked architecture and plant ecological strategies
(White, 1983a; Ackerly, 1996). To date, approaches linking
plant architecture and function are scarce although some
architectural indexes can assess interesting strategies such
as defense against herbivores (“Index of caginess,” CharlesDominique et al., 2017) or leaf-to-stem relation that trigger
flowering (“Index of axialisation,” Lauri, 1988; Lauri and Kelner,
2001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

which assesses branching incidence on functional traits that
influence assimilation and exploration functions. Considering
each understory species of Atractocarpus in New Caledonia, we
analyzed correlations between architecture and traits associated
with key ecologically significant functions (viz., photosynthesis,
hydraulic, mechanics, and dispersal). We investigated the
evolution of plant architecture (branched vs. unbranched) in
forest understory species and its impact on the exceptional
diversification rate of the genus. Finally, we explored how
ecological opportunities might stimulate the diversification of
architecture through spatial differentiation in resource use (niche
partitioning) in closely related species following the colonization
of New Caledonian rainforests.

Sampling
We sampled all the 27 known rainforest species of Atractocarpus
occurring in New Caledonia (list of taxa in Appendix 1 in
Supplementary Material). For Ancestral Character Estimation
(ACE), three Australian Atractocarpus species and one species in
each of the most closely related genera for which DNA sequences
were available (Mouly et al., 2014, under review) were included
as outgroups.
Individuals were sampled in 20 rainforest sites occurring
on Grande Terre, New Caledonia’s main island (Appendix 1 in
Supplementary Material).

Evolution of Plant Architecture in Atractocarpus

Branching Index and Plant Architectural
Traits

12 due to small population sizes and habitat degradation, so
these taxa were removed from this analysis. We concentrated
our sampling in the apical part of the trunk because (i) this
enabled standardization of physiological age and (ii) unbranched
and branched species can be compared only on the basis of
the main stem. Moreover, variation in resource allocation and
anatomy between unbranched and branched species might be
more prevalent toward the apex, where large leaves are deployed
(Carlquist, 1974). Stem and leaf measurements were standardized
as follows. Leaf traits (SLA, leaf area) were measured on the five
youngest, fully expended leaves of the main axis (trunk). Wood
was collected below the terminal leaf tuft for the measurement
of anatomical traits (proportion of tissues, specific wood density,
and specific stem density). Internode length and diameter were
measured on the five youngest, well-developed trunk-internodes
(before secondary growth). Branch traits (cumulated length,
leaf number, leaf area) were measured on two representative
branches per individual and the total number of branches was
counted.
Most of the individuals studied in the field were infertile,
so fruit traits were measured on herbarium specimens [NOU
and P; acronyms follow Thiers (continuously updated)]. We
selected undamaged and unflattened fruits from which length
and diameter were measured. As Atractocarpus fruits are often
ellipsoid to tubular (Puttock, 1999), these two dimensions are
used to approximate fruit volume (Table 1). A total of 592 fruits
were measured, and only the five largest fruits per taxon (four for
A. confertus and A. sessilifolius) were used to ensure that values
from only mature fruits were included in our analyses. One of
the species, A. sp. nov. 6, is a very rare species whose fruits have
never been observed; it was consequently excluded from the fruit
volume dataset.

Based on the observation that an observed architectural gradient
might result from differential allocation in branch length and
supported leaf area (Figure 1), we used two functional branching
indexes based on the differentiation of function from branches to
trunk (Corner, 1958). Given that photosynthetic function can be
approximated by leaf area (Pérez-Harguindeguy et al., 2013) and
exploration function by stem length (Barthélémy and Caraglio,
2007; Smith et al., 2014), branching indexes were calculated as
follows:
Leaf area supported by branches
Total leaf area (branches+trunk)
Branches cumulated length
Total stem length (branches+trunk)

(i) Photosynthetic branching index:
(ii) Exploration branching index:

A value of zero indicates that photosynthesis and exploration
are assumed only by the trunk and that branches (lateral
exploration) are lacking, which corresponds to the monocaulous
habit, physiognomically defined as “trees with a single trunk
or visible stem of the plant” (Hallé et al., 1978). The higher
the value of the index, the greater the functional role played
by branches. We built a single integrative branching index
that expresses the architectural gradient by combining these
two variables using Principal Component Analysis (correlation
between photosynthetic and exploration branching indexes:
rho = 0.86) employed in the ade4 package for R (Dray and
Dufour, 2007).
Species were segregated into three architectural classes
(Monocaulous, Intermediate, and Branched) using Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests that enable detection of breaks in the
distribution of the integrative branching index.
Using morphological criteria reviewed by Barthélémy and
Caraglio (2007), we then described main traits commonly
used in architectural analyses (growth process, branching
pattern, position of reproductive structures, etc.) for the 27
New Caledonian species of Atractocarpus. The number of
individuals studied varied from more than a hundred in
some species (e.g., A. pseudoterminalis, A. ngoyensis and
A. bracteatus) to 12 in A. sezitat, a rare species whose
habitat is highly disturbed by introduced herbivores. All
species were studied at different ontogenetic stages (from
very young plants to senescent adults) except A. sezitat
and A. sp. nov. 12, for which no young plants could be
found.

Data Analysis
Phylogenetic Tree
The molecular phylogeny of Mouly et al. (under review) was used
for analysis. This ultrametric phylogenetic tree was constructed
under Bayesian Inference using one nuclear (ITS) and two
chloroplastic (trnTL, rpl32) loci. Since the current study focused
on rainforest species, we pruned the five dry forest and maquis
species using the R software (Ver. 3.4.3).

Phylogenetic Signal
We assessed phylogenetic independence of measured traits
(Felsenstein, 1985) using two complementary statistics calculated
under a Brownian Motion (BM) model of evolution. Pagel’s
Lambda (Pagel, 1999; Freckleton et al., 2002) is widely
used for low rates of type I error and robustness, even
for poorly or moderately informative phylogenies (Freckleton
et al., 2002; Münkemüller et al., 2012). Because this statistic
loses statistical power when used on small phylogenies (<30
terminals, Freckleton et al., 2002), we also used Blomberg’s Kappa
(Blomberg et al., 2003; Kembel, 2009) that is less robust but more
appropriate for small taxonomic sampling (until 20 taxa, Kamilar
and Cooper, 2013). Both statistics were calculated considering
intraspecific variation using the phytools package for R (Revell,
2012).

Plant Functional Traits
We tested the correlation of 14 traits with branching index.
The traits were selected to reflect important features of plant
ecological strategies (Table 1). They were measured on five
individuals per species and, when possible (e.g., for leaf
and internode traits), five times per individual. The selection
of individuals was standardized for environment (rainforest
understory) and for ontogeny following three criteria: (i)
recently mature individuals, (ii) non reiterated individuals (see
Oldeman, 1974; Barthélémy and Caraglio, 2007), and (iii) nontraumatized trunks. It was not possible to locate individuals
meeting all three conditions for A. sezitat and A. sp. nov.

genus, Ancestral Character Estimation (ACE) was performed.
We assigned an architectural class to each of the 11 outgroup
species based on published descriptions (Fosberg, 1987; Smith
and Darwin, 1988; Fosberg et al., 1993; Puttock, 1999; Wong,
2004; Zahid and Wong, 2004, 2010; Tong et al., 2013), herbaria
specimens (P, K, BM, E) and available photos. The ACE were
performed using a maximum likelihood method under the ape
package for R (Paradis et al., 2004). Three possible models of
evolution fitted the data characteristics: (i) equal transition rates
between classes (ER), (ii) different transition rates between classes
but with equal rates for reversions (SYM), and (iii) different rates
for every transition (ARD). The best model was selected using the
corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc).

Trait Correlations and Functional Characterization
We used phylogenetic regression based on the method proposed
by Ives et al. (2007) and implemented in the phytools package
for R (Revell, 2012) to test whether architectural variation
was correlated with functional specialization. Using maximum
likelihood, this method fits bivariate models taking into account
both phylogenetic framework and intraspecific variation. The
response variable was the integrative branching index, and the
explanatory variables were all other functional traits (Table 1).
Significance of relations was tested using a likelihood ratio test
between the model and a model constrained with a slope of zero.
To characterize the functional space of each architectural
classes, we performed a Principal Component Analysis. We used
the species arithmetical mean of each functional traits (branching
index excluded), and functional differences between architectural
classes (Monocaulous, Intermediate, Branched) were tested with
a permanova (Vegan package for R, Oksanen et al., 2018).

Trait Based Diversification
To test whether one of the architectural classes has contributed
more than the others to the diversification of New Caledonian
Atractocarpus (by increasing speciation rates and/or decreasing
extinction rates), we used the Multiple State Speciation
Extinction (MuSSE) framework (Fitzjohn et al., 2009) as
implemented in the diversitree package for R (Fitzjohn, 2012).

Evolution of Plant Architecture in Atractocarpus

For this analysis, outgroups were dropped from the phylogeny
to consider only the 27 rainforest Atractocarpus species. Fifteen
models of diversification were used, each differing in whether
or not of speciation, extinction and transition rates were equal
between classes (Table 2). Model selection was done according to
AICc.

the branching position of C1, which was continuous for
some monocaulous species while diffuse for others. Two main
quantitative architectural traits varied greatly among species, the
number of modules per branch and the length of modules, which
decreased in monocaulous species (Table 3, Figures 3, 4). For
example, A. longistipitatus is a monocaulous species whose C2
comprise many very short modules (apart from the first one). By
contrast, A. bracteatus is also monocaulous but its C2 comprise
a single long module (Figure 4). The number of internodes
per module vary little in the genus but tend to be reduced in
monocaulous species, with an extreme case of one node per
module in A. confertus (Table 3). All species showed the ability
to develop delayed reiterate on damaged or aged individuals.

RESULTS
Branching Index
Branching indexes confirmed the existence of a morphofunctional gradient from branched to monocaulous species of
Atractocarpus, for both exploration and photosynthetic functions
(Figures 2A,B). For both indexes, interspecific variation was
too gradual to allow the partitioning in distinct classes, but
when combined (i.e., using the branching index), three distinct
architectural groups could be differentiated (Wilcoxon tests:
P < 0.1, Figure 2C), viz. the branched, intermediate and
monocaulous architectural classes. On average, branched species
had 82% of photosynthesis and 76% of exploration provided by
branches, vs. 36 and 45%, respectively, for intermediate species,
and 3 and 16% for monocaulous species.

Functional Characterization
Phylogenetic signal varied substantially depending on which
statistic was used (Lambda or Kappa, Table 4). This was probably
due to the small size of our phylogeny (25 terminals), since
the statistics differ in sensitivity to the number of terminals
(Freckleton et al., 2002; Kamilar and Cooper, 2013). Blomberg’s
Kappa captures significant phylogenetic signal for stem specific
density, proportion of pith, Huber value, and mean leaf area,
whereas Pagel’s Lambda captures significant signal for internode
diameter (Table 4). Among all measured functional traits, only
the branching index had a highly significant phylogenetic signal
calculated with both Pagel’s Lambda and Blomberg’s Kappa.
Several functional traits were significantly related to the
branching index (Table 5), including biomechanics (e.g.,
slenderness ratio, internode diameter) as well as photosynthesis
(e.g., leaf area, SLA), hydraulics (e.g., Huber value), and even
dispersal (fruit volume). These correlations between architecture
and functions were confirmed by PCA and Permanova
(P = 0.016), which showed significant differences between the
functional space occupied by the three architectural classes
(Figure 5). Intermediate species were confounded between the
two other architectural classes, but monocaulous and branched
species appeared to be functionally very different. In comparison
to monocaulous species, branched taxa tend to have numerous
small leaves, higher SLA, smaller fruits and, smaller internode
diameters with a lower proportion of wood, but a higher wood
area-leaf area ratio (Huber value). The monocaulous A. confertus
(the lowest point on Figure 5) was distinct from the other
Atractocarpus species examined in having numerous very large
leaves, leading to a disproportionately higher total leaf area (up
to 2.4 m² vs. a mean of 0.5 m² for the other species).

Architectural Characterization
The architecture of New Caledonian Atractocarpus species
involves two axis categories: (i) a trunk (C1), i.e., an orthotropic
monopodium with continuous indeterminate growth, and (ii)
“branches” (C2), i.e., orthotropic sympodia with terminal
sexuality conferring rhythmic growth (Table 3, Figure 3). The
sympodial branching of C2 always originates in a hypotonic
(i.e., on the lower surface) or amphitonic position, resulting
in upward flower exposure (Figure 1). The only qualitative
architectural variation observed between species concerned

Ancestral Character Estimation
All considered outgroup species belonged to the branched
architectural class, except for the Fijian Sukunia pentagonoides
(Seem.) A.C.Sm, which is monocaulous. Among the three
possible models of evolution that fitted the data, the best
supported one was that of equal transition rates between classes
(ER), with an AICc of 84.4 vs. 96.1 and 104.2 for SYM and ARD,
respectively. According to this model, the ancestral architecture
of Atractocarpus was most likely branched (probability = 0.98,
Figure 6), and the monocaulous habit evolved two or three
times in the two main New Caledonian clades (referred to

species with an intermediate architecture are closely related to
monocaulous species, the only exception being A. brandzeanus,
whose closest relatives are branched. Conversely, pairs of sister or
closely related species never showed branched and monocaulous
habit.

Following the IACc, models 2 and 10 are the best fitted, in
which speciation and transition rates are equal for each state
and extinction rates are equal or null (Table 2). This means that
diversification was not greater among the members of any of the
architectural classes during the evolution of Atractocarpus in New
Caledonia.

DISCUSSION

The measurement of functionally explicit variables (branch
length and leaf area) that link plant architecture and function
(Lauri, 1988; Lauri and Kelner, 2001; Charles-Dominique et al.,
2017) showed that variation of growth habit in Atractocarpus
is correlated with a gradual variation from branched species,
for which photosynthesis and exploration are largely assumed
by branches, toward monocaulous species, for which these
functions are assumed by the trunk. The reduced C2 in
monocaulous species supports a limited number of small leaves
(on average 4 leaves of 9 cm2 ) and are dedicated almost

Evolution of Plant Architecture
Despite the diversity of growth habits in the genus Atractocarpus,
ranging from well branched to monocaulous species, the
architectural construction of members of the group is fairly
homogenous. Differences between species mainly result from
quantitative variations in which the number of modules per
branches and module length tend to increase with increasing
branching index.

exclusively to reproduction. These “axes” are functionally closer
to inflorescences than branches (Van Steenis, 1963) and are often
considered as such by taxonomists (e.g., Fosberg et al., 1993;
Puttock, 1999).
The branched architectural class appears to be ancestral
in Atractocarpus and our results indicated at least two
independent origins of monocauly in New Caledonia. Other
examples of derived monocauly have recently been revealed
in flowering plants (Chomicki et al., 2017; Barrabé et al.,
2018). The intermediate architectural class is evolutionary
closer to the monocaulous habit since intermediate and
monocaulous species are always sister taxa or very close
relatives. There is a high probability that the putative ancestor
of “monocaulous clade B,” had an intermediate architecture.
This insight, as well as the architectural gradient observed
among extant species, suggests a gradual evolutionary transition
from the branched architecture toward monocauly through an
intermediate architectural class. Reversion from a monocaulous
architecture toward an intermediate one appears to have been
possible (e.g., Atractocarpus sp. nov. 7) but full reversion to a
branched architecture was not observed.
The similarity of developmental origin and the gradual
quantitative architectural variation of lateral axes (C2) across
closely related taxa suggest a homologous origin of these
axes in the Atractocarpus species studied here (see Nozeran,
1955; Rossignol and Rossignol, 1985; Haicour et al., 1989). A
homologous origin between vegetative and inflorescence axes
has been suspected in several groups such as Ranunculaceae
and Papaveraceae (Stebbins, 1973), as well as several families
of Alismatales (Posluszny and Charlton, 1993, 1999) and
Pandanales (Rudall and Bateman, 2006), though none of
these studies combined architectural analysis with molecular
phylogenetic results.
Only a few studies to date have explored evolutionary links
between architectural models (see Chomicki et al., 2017). In
New Caledonia Atractocarpus, we found recurrent transitions
from Stone’s model for branched species (with C2 functioning
as branches) to Corner’s model for monocaulous species (with
C2 functioning as inflorescences), although the limit between
them remains fuzzy, as illustrated by species whose architecture
is intermediate. The variation observed in branching degree
across species illustrates an “architectural continuum” (Oldeman,
1974; Barthélémy et al., 1989) rather than saltational evolution
involving rapid and profound change in architecture (Bateman
and DiMichele, 1994; Bateman, 1999). Nothing suggests that
the intermediate architectural class confers lower fitness (i.e.,
represents a fitness valley) compared to monocaulous or
branched architecture, particularly in situations where the
environment (rainforest understory) varies gradually. Saltation
from one model to another might take place when gradual
changes are impossible, for example in the colonization of
contrasted habitats (Bateman and DiMichele, 1994). Gradual
variation between and within models has already been noted
(Hallé et al., 1978), suggesting that preferential transition between
models might occur.
The two independent origins of monocauly inferred in
Atractocarpus illustrate two different evolutionary pathways

involved in the transition from branches into inflorescences.
In “monocaulous clade A,” reduction in the branching index
occurred through a reduction in the number of modules, while in
“monocaulous clade B,” module length is involved. Architectural
analysis actually showed that the two species with intermediate
architecture and the two monocaulous species belonging to the
clade B are those with the higher number of modules (up to 46
for the intermediate A. sessilifolius and 26 the for monocaulous
A. longistipitatus, i.e., as much as certain branched species)
and with shorter module length (excluding the monocaulous A.
confertus). This type of morphological reduction observed at the

2001; Westoby et al., 2002; Preston and Ackerly, 2003; Westoby
and Wright, 2003; Pickup et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2006; Normand
et al., 2008). Large leaves and fruit carried by a large single
stem, as seen in monocaulous species, illustrate one extremity of
this spectrum. The second rule (diminution of ramification), has
received much less consideration (but see White, 1983a; Ackerly
and Donoghue, 1998). Our results agree with this statement,
as we have shown that internode diameter, as well as fruit
and leaf size, are negatively correlated with branching index,
even with phylogenetic corrections. Beyond Corner’s rules, we
found a strong correlation between branching index and several
functional traits related to various ecological strategies in areas
with a similar habitat (i.e., rainforest).
We found that branching index tends to be correlated with
ecologically important dimensions (Mooney, 1972; Grime, 1974;
Grime et al., 1988; Westoby et al., 2002). The large leaves
of monocaulous species increase light interception in shady
understory (Poorter, 1999; Rozendaal et al., 2006), their low SLA
and Huber value are likely associated with low photosynthetic
capacity (Field and Mooney, 1986; Shipley et al., 2005; Poorter
and Bongers, 2006; Rozendaal et al., 2006; Pérez-Harguindeguy
et al., 2013) and their small internode length can result from
a slow growth rate (Mooney, 1972; Chuah, 1977; Grime et al.,
1988; Westoby et al., 2002). Monocaulous species are likely
skewed toward a high resource conservation strategy (Grime
et al., 1997; Díaz et al., 2004, 2016) suited to the shady understory
of rainforest.
In sparsely branched to unbranched species, a distal part of
the stem with thicker diameter and higher wood proportion
was found to be suited to supporting large and numerous
energetically costly leaves (higher leaf area and SLA). However,
higher wood area does not fully compensate for high total leaf
area of the main stem since the Huber value (the ratio of

of organization in other plant groups (e.g., annual shoots, growth
units, metamers, etc.).
The iterative gradual transition of axillary structure (C2) from
branches to inflorescences occurs as a functional reduction of
vegetative growth and a change in the timing of flowering. Such
evolutionary changes, often result from growth heterochrony
(Smith, 2001). In the case of New Caledonian Atractocarpus,
the axillary structure (C2) of descendants is either a truncated
part (in “monocaulous clade A”) or a miniaturized copy (in
“monocaulous clade B”) of that of their ancestors. This suggests
heterochronic evolution through “neoteny” in the first case and
through “proportional dwarfism” in the second (Gould, 1977;
Alberch et al., 1979; Smith, 2001), but more details of the
ontogenetic sequences are required to test these hypotheses in
Atractocarpus.
In this context, our original approach showed that a careful
study of low organization levels is needed to depict the evolution
of plant architecture. This involves a deep characterization of
architectural units (Edelin, 1977, 1984), combining qualitative
and quantitative traits.

Branching Index, Corner’s Rules, and
Ecological Strategies
In the original Durian theory, Corner (1949, 1953-1954)
proposed two fundamental rules governing plant morphology: (i)
Axial conformity, stipulating that “the stouter, or more massive,
the axis in a given species, the larger and more complicated its
appendages”; and (ii) Diminution on ramification, stipulating that
“the greater the ramification, the smaller become the branches
and their appendages”. Axial conformity is by far the most studied
since the leaf size—twig size and fruit size—leaf size spectra are
among the best-documented (White, 1983b; Bond and Midgley,
1988; Brouat et al., 1998; Cornelissen, 1999; Brouat and McKey,

successful establishment (Silvertown, 2004). The large, fleshy
fruits of Atractocarpus suggest a rather limited ability for longdistance dispersal. Such niche preemption, claimed to act as a
major driver of monophyly and diversification in island floras
(Silvertown, 2004), could have prevailed in the diversification
of the New Caledonian clade of Atractocarpus. Its young age
(estimated at 2.4 My) coincides with colonization during late
Pleistocene, a period of intense climatic Fluctuation (Bowler
et al., 1976; Hope and Pask, 1998; Stevenson and Hope,
2005). Increasing evidence supports the persistence of taxa in
rainforest refugia during the Pleistocene in New Caledonia

wood area to leaf area) was positively correlated with branching
index. Detailed anatomical studies, particularly on vessel size and
density, are needed to understand the hydraulic and mechanical
trade-off involved in the pervasive link between leaf area, stem
thickness and branching degree (Lehnebach et al., 2018).

Divergence and Ecological Opportunities
in New Caledonian Rainforests
New Caledonian Atractocarpus appear to be the result of a
single colonization event (Mouly et al., under review) and the
archipelago is the center of diversity for the genus. Island
colonization is a two steps process involving dispersal and

et al., 2013; Pouteau et al., 2015; Tournebize et al., 2017).
Climatic fluctuations causing expansion and contraction of
rainforests could also have offered ecological opportunities
for new colonizers. Other diversified rainforest clades in New
Caledonia have been shown to result from recent colonization
(e.g., palms, Pintaud et al., 2001; Pillon, 2012). Similarities in
form and physiology among close relatives, as suggested by
our character state reconstruction and architectural analysis, are
suggested to involve intense competition that favors divergence
among locally coexisting species (Givnish, 2016). In support of
this, we found notable variation in module length and number
between sisters species, even when they belong to the same
architectural class. In Atractocarpus, variation in growth habit is
correlated with a gradual switch in assimilation function from
branches to trunk, and is associated with a vertical differentiation
of major functions. Leaf arrangement in monocaulous species
results in important overlap that impacts photosynthesis, while
stem slenderness suggests a rather small structural investment
in vertical support. Branched species tend to increase light
harvesting and reduce leaf overlap (via increase branch length),
a strategy that require more investment in stem tissue (Givnish,
1995), as allocation to non-leaf structures might increase with
ramification. Atractocarpus species thus exhibit a gradient of
foraging for light in which leaf size and disposition vary with the
degree of ramification.
New Caledonian rainforests are characterized by a low
canopy (ca. 20 m) and trees with small crowns (Blanchard
et al., 2016), two structural features that increase the number
and intensity of sunflecks (Chazdon and Pearcy, 1991). A low
canopy and its corollary, reduced forest stratification, could
result in stronger competition within a given stratum. These
forest features (high sunfleck variability, reduced stratification)
favor niche partitioning through a gradient in architecture
and related functional traits. Moreover, limited dispersal of
the large fruits of Atractocarpus might interact with niche
partitioning to promote divergent evolution. Finally, divergent
selection may be especially favored in permissive environments
where competition prevails over the external environment or
in the colonization of islands where resources are underutilized
(Givnish, 2016). New Caledonia exhibits both components of
divergent selection: (i) climatically permissive rainforests and (ii)
ecological opportunities offered by recent climatic fluctuations.
Divergent selection, caused by competition among closely related
taxa, leads to adaptive radiation, i.e., the rise of a diversity
of ecological roles and related adaptations in different species
among a lineage (Givnish, 2016). The theory of niche preemption holds that adaptive radiation creates a barrier that
inhibits the establishment of closely related taxa, thus reducing
the likelihood of repeated colonization.

clearly highlights evolutionary processes behind architectural
transitions and their link to plant ecological strategy and
perhaps also to diversification. We have shown that gradual
transition from one architecture to a very different one is
possible through morpho-functional reduction of morphological
units. Quantifying plant architecture through functional indexes
appears to offer a promising avenue toward further understand
the implications of architectural variation on plant fitness under
different environmental conditions. Based on such an index,
our study provides a functional definition of monocauly that is
ecologically and evolutionary more explicit than one based solely
on physiognomy (cf. Hallé et al., 1978; Chomicki et al., 2017):
we define monocaulous species as woody plants whose cardinal
functions (e.g., assimilation and exploration) rely on a single
apparent stem.
Although our work focused on a small clade, it opens new
perspectives and proposes a general framework for further
understanding evolution of plant architecture and its functional
implications in other plant groups and other geographical
areas, and at larger scales. We believe that Pleistocene climatic
fluctuations have played a major role in the evolution of
monocauly and more widely in shaping the current diversity
of the New Caledonian flora. This hypothesis now needs to be
tested at a larger phylogenetic scale in New Caledonia, as the
monocaulous habit, which occurs repetitively in many different
groups (Veillon, 1976; Schmid, 1979, 1990), has much to offer to
understand the evolution, biogeography and ecology of this “very
old Darwinian island” (Grandcolas et al., 2008).
