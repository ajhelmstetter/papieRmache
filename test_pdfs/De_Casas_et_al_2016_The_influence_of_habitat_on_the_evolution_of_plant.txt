 Background and Aims Organismal evolution tends to be closely associated with ecological conditions.
However, the extent to which this association constrains adaptation or diversification into new habitats remains
unclear. We studied habitat evolution in the hyper-diverse angiosperm clade Saxifragales.
 Methods We used species-level phylogenies for approx. 950 species to analyse the evolution of habitat shifts as
well as their influence on plant diversification. We combined habitat characterization based on floristic assignments
and state-of-the art phylogenetic comparative methods to estimate within- and across-habitat diversification
patterns.
 Key Results Our analyses showed that Saxifragales diversified into multiple habitats from a forest-inhabiting ancestor and that this diversification is governed by relatively rare habitat shifts. Lineages are likely to stay within inferred ancestral ecological conditions. Adaptation to some habitat types (e.g. aquatic, desert) may be canalizing
events that lineages do not escape. Although associations between increased diversification rates and shifts in
habitat preferences are occasionally observed, extreme macroevolutionary rates are closely associated with specific
habitats. Lineages occurring in shrubland, and especially tundra and rock cliffs, exhibit comparatively high diversification, whereas forest, grassland, desert and aquatic habitats are associated with low diversification.
 Conclusions The likelihood of occupation of new habitats appears to be asymmetric. Shifts to aquatic and desert
habitats may be canalizing events. Other habitats, such as tundra, might act as evolutionary sources, while forests
provide the only habitat seemingly colonized easily by lineages originating elsewhere. However, habitat shifts are
very rare, and any major environmental alteration is expected to have dramatic evolutionary consequences.

INTRODUCTION
Modern evolutionary ecology has been strongly influenced by
the idea that most diversification tends to occur within ancestral
ecological conditions. This principle, termed phylogenetic
niche conservatism (PNC), results in related species occurring
in similar environments (Harvey and Pagel, 1991; Wiens and
Graham, 2005; Donoghue, 2008; Crisp and Cook, 2012).
However, it is undeniable that biome shifts and the colonization
of new habitats have also been prevalent throughout evolutionary history (Donoghue and Edwards, 2014)
To date, we lack the capacity to define clearly the environmental or functional factors constraining ecological shifts at an
evolutionary scale (Crisp and Cook, 2012). However, anticipating the rate of adaptation to and diversification into new environments seems crucial to apprehend the evolutionary
consequences of global change (Parmesan, 2006). It has been
argued that current human-induced climate change might lead

to widespread extinction because it outpaces both the rate of adaptation in situ and the ability of organisms to track moving
habitat boundaries (Corlett and Westcott, 2013; Kubisch et al.,
2013; Quintero and Wiens, 2013). At this point, however, we
cannot make general predictions about the consequences of
habitat changes for the conservation of biodiversity above the
species level (Wiens et al., 2010). In this context, analyses of
past habitat shifts might provide valuable insights into the evolutionary significance of future perturbations (Donoghue, 2008;
Wiens et al., 2010).
Increasing temperatures and changes in rainfall seasonality
are predicted to affect the relative expansion or contraction of
habitat types across ecotones (Van Auken, 2000; Parmesan,
2006; Hirota et al., 2010; He et al., 2015). Variable environmental boundaries are also expected to be highly consequential
to the distribution and range of discontinuous habitats such as
wetlands (Hamilton, 2010; Oberlander et al., 2014; Saintilan
and Rogers, 2015). Anticipating the biodiversity consequences

Rubio de Casas et al. — Habitat evolution in Saxifragales
sensu APG III (2009; APG IV 2016 was published after our study
was complete) recognized 15 families in Saxifragales: Altingiaceae, Aphanopetalaceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, Crassulaceae, Daphniphyllaceae, Grossulariaceae, Haloragaceae Hamamelidaceae,
Iteaceae, Paeoniaceae, Penthoraceae, Peridiscaceae, Pterostemonaceae, Saxifragaceae, and Tetracarpaeaceae. This angiosperm
clade of approx. 2500 species has a rich fossil record and is
hyper-diverse morphologically, including trees, shrubs, lianas, annual and perennial herbs, succulents and aquatics that occur in a
wide variety of habitats, including forest, aquatic, grasslands, desert shrubland and tundra. No other clade of angiosperms of comparable size harbours so much diversity.
Both molecular data and the fossil record suggest that the
diversification of Saxifragales was rapid and provide a welldefined time frame for the evolution of the group. Fossils
indicate that Saxifragales was once more diverse and widespread than the extant members suggest and that the group
encompassed wide phenotypic diversity early in its history
(Fishbein et al., 2001; Jian et al., 2008). Jian et al. (2008) estimated the origin and subsequent diversification of
Saxifragales as between 112 (6 97) and 120 (6 102) million years ago, with the major lineages within the clade appearing in as little as 3–6 million years ago. Moreover, the
phylogenetic relationships of Saxifragales have been analysed in detail, and a well-resolved large tree covering much
of the extant species diversity is already available (Jian et
al., 2008; Soltis et al., 2013). The wealth of available information makes Saxifragales one of the best sampled and resolved large clades and thus an ideal case study for detailed,
large-scale evolutionary ecology analyses.
We have used the rich data available for Saxifragales and recently developed tools for macroevolutionary analysis to explore the effect of habitat specialization and habitat shifts on
plant diversification. Our aims were to investigate the consequences for speciation and extinction associated with specific
habitats and to explore the probabilities of diversification across
habitat borders. We focused on five habitat boundaries that
have been reported as important for angiosperm evolution and
to be likely to shift as a consequence of climate change: forest/
tundra, grassland/forest, shrubland/forest, grassland/shrubland
and shrubland/desert. We addressed these objectives by analysing: (a) the evolutionary history of habitat occupation in
Saxifragales, to determine the habitat of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the group; (b) the relative diversification rates associated with each habitat type and the
consequences for diversification of habitat shifts, whether anagenetic or cladogenetic; and (c) the evolutionary dynamics
across the five focal habitat boundaries (i.e. the relative likelihood of lineages in each habitat to colonize the other).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Phylogenetic hypothesis and habitat coding

The phylogeny used in all analyses was the maximum likelihood (ML) tree described in Soltis et al. (2013). Briefly, this
tree is a phylogeny of Saxifragales at the species level that contains 950 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) – 368 % of
species-level diversity of the clade. The tree was obtained using
a supermatrix approach and ML estimations. Branch lengths

of these changes in habitat distribution and availability requires
the capacity to estimate the likelihood of the lineages occupying each habitat to adapt to new conditions and/or shift into surrounding environments.
Organisms exhibit a general tendency to retain traits associated with ancestral ecological conditions throughout evolution
(Harvey and Pagel, 1991; Holt and Gaines, 1992). This implies
that habitat shifts are more likely to occur between habitats
with overlapping environmental conditions than between more
extreme habitats. It also implies that the transitions to and from
habitats requiring a higher degree of specialization will be less
frequent, whereas ‘intermediate’ habitats might facilitate the
transition among more extreme habitats. In particular, environments such as deserts and aquatic habitats might require very
specific suites of adaptations that can be hypothesized to limit
the rates of colonization by and diversification of angiosperms
(Stebbins, 1974; Cook, 1999; Guerrero et al., 2013).
From a phylogenetic perspective, adaptation to a new habitat
can be described as an anagenetic habitat shift (i.e. a change
along a branch of the tree that results in habitat replacement).
However, in many cases, habitat changes will not affect all populations of a given taxon equally (Harte et al., 2004). Some
populations might remain within the ancestral environment
while others may face more drastic changes (Bellard et al.,
2012). As a result, some daughter taxa will not shift habitat
while others will, thereby undergoing a cladogenetic habitat
shift. Whether past habitat shifts have been associated with
cladogenesis, anagenesis or extinction might be indicative of
the evolutionary consequences of environmental change for a
given group (Condamine et al., 2013).
In the case of plants, certain habitat shifts appear to be particularly important from an evolutionary perspective (Stebbins,
1974; Donoghue and Edwards, 2014). For instance, ecotones
such as forest/tundra, grassland/forest, shrubland/forest, grassland/shrubland and shrubland/desert have been found to be important from a biogeographical and phylogenetic perspective.
Many plant groups appear to have originated in forest environments and later adapted to and colonized drier, more disturbed
and colder habitats. This ‘out of the forest’ transition appears to
have been a key step for the formation of tundra, grasslands
and Mediterranean shrublands (i.e. chaparral; Murray, 1995;
Verd
u et al., 2003; Ackerly, 2004; Edwards and Smith, 2010;
Brochmann et al., 2013). On the other hand, several grassland
lineages seem to have originated in drier, shrubland-like environments (Lamont et al., 2013). This same kind of habitat
seems to have been occupied by the ancestors of several desert
lineages (Heibl and Renner, 2012; Pittermann et al., 2012;
Guerrero et al., 2013). Consequently, it can be hypothesized
that when comparing the likelihood of habitat shifts, it should
be easier to find evidence for evolutionary shifts from forest
habitats into tundra, grasslands or shrubland and from shrubland into grasslands and deserts than the reverse.
Studying the influence of habitat associations in the evolution of a group of organisms requires that the group exhibit
wide phylogenetic diversity, with several independent lineages
occurring in different habitats. Moreover, a robust, dated phylogenetic hypothesis including taxa that occur across all of the
habitats should be available.
Saxifragales are one such group that permit rigorous analysis
of habitat associations in a phylogenetic context. Saxifragales

Rubio de Casas et al. — Habitat evolution in Saxifragales

Ancestral state reconstructions

Habitat evolution in Saxifragales was reconstructed using the
supermatrix-based tree and the discrete habitat codes described
above. Ancestral habitat reconstructions were performed using
a continuous Markov model of discrete character evolution
(MkN; Pagel, 1994; Lewis, 2001) employing a Bayesian approximation with diversitree (FitzJohn, 2012). Three different
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains were started with
priors of rate 0001, 001 and 01, respectively, and run for
100 000 steps with exponential prior distributions. Chain

convergence was verified using the R package coda (Plummer
et al., 2006). All chains converged within the first 1000 generations. Nevertheless, to be conservative, we discarded the first
10 000 steps of every chain and concatenated the last 90 000
steps for each run together to form the posterior probability
distributions.
Our phylogenetic tree is almost fully resolved. However,
diversitree requires dichotomous trees, so we randomly dichotomized the phylogeny, replacing polytomies with branches of
length zero with the function ‘multi2di’ in the ape R package
(Paradis et al., 2004). This transformation was relatively small,
as only 106 of the 1877 branches had to be replaced and they
were all terminal. Another limitation of diversitree is that it cannot incorporate polymorphic data at the tips. To investigate the
possible consequences of dichotomizing the tree and the simplification of habitat data, we also reconstructed the ancestral habitat of Saxifragales using Bayesian stochastic mapping
(Bollback, 2006) as implemented in the R package phytools
(Revell, 2012). We ran SIMMAP (StochastIc Mutational
Mapping on Phylogenies; Bollback, 2006) analyses on the original tree for 10 000 iterations and considering both simple and
polymorphic habitat coding for all extant species.

Diversification analyses

Although estimating diversification rates from phylogenetic
trees containing only extant diversity is problematic (Quental
and Marshall, 2010; Rabosky, 2010; Rabosky and Goldberg,
2015), we decided to employ this frequently used approach to
compare rates among habitats. The level of sampling in our tree
is relatively high; other than the Daphniphyllaceae (only 4 % of
taxa included), all families were represented by at least 21 %
(Iteaceae) of their members, with the sampling of the largest
families covering at least 25 % of extant diversity
(Crassulaceae 365 out of approx. 1450 species, Saxifragaceae
243/approx. 800 species, Grossulariaceae 97/approx. 200 species, Hamamelidaceae 50/approx. 100 species). Therefore, there
is no reason to believe that our sampling is biased and we assumed that statistical errors should be neutral and the relative
habitat comparisons valid, at least qualitatively (Morlon, 2014).
The influence of habitat associations on the diversification
and macroevolutionary dynamics of Saxifragales was investigated using two recently developed methods. First, we used the
Cladogenetic State change Speciation and Extinction algorithm
(ClaSSE; Goldberg and Igic, 2012) implemented in diversitree
to estimate rates of habitat change and extinction. ClaSSE is an
extension of the commonly used BiSSE algorithm (Binary
Speciation and Extinction; Maddison et al., 2007; FitzJohn,
2012) that allows for cladogenetic character changes by assuming that transitions along the phylogeny may occur either at observed nodes or at nodes where the bifurcation is not observed
due to subsequent extinction of one daughter lineage. ClaSSE
incorporates this by computing additional speciation rates, kiij
and kijj, in which one of the daughter lineages retains the parent
state ‘i’ and the other acquires a new state ‘j’. Additionally,
ClaSSE estimates anagenetic changes as shifts within a single
lineage (q01, q10) in a similar way as state-independent models
of discrete trait evolution such as MkN (Lewis, 2001; Goldberg
and Igic, 2012; Smith and Goldberg, 2015). A full ClaSSE

were later calculated using penalized likelihood as implemented
in r8s (Sanderson, 2002, 2003) with the time constraints described in Jian et al. (2008).
Determining the habitat characteristics of large taxonomic
sets is problematic because sampling effort is necessarily different among species (i.e. not all species are equally well sampled
across their range). Moreover, quantitative habitat characterizations of biological niches rely on distributional data stored in repositories such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility
(GBIF) and environmental characterizations based on modelled
climatic values such as the BIOCLIM WorldClim variables.
These large-scale approaches are very powerful and have been
used successfully to infer climate-related evolution in several
cases (e.g. Zanne et al., 2014; Wüest et al., 2015). However,
these approaches can be easily mired by erroneously or incompletely labelled accessions and poor global sampling (Yesson
et al., 2007; Feeley and Silman, 2010; Edwards et al., 2015).
Moreover, these methods cannot account for fine-grained differences in environmental ranges; for instance, a species occurring only within vernal pools is bound to have the same
geographic co-ordinates and associated climatic values as one
right on the edge of the pool. In the same way, the habitat of
cliff-dwelling species cannot be distinguished from that of
plants occurring right below or right above the cliffs.
To overcome these limitations, we used a complementary approach consisting of the characterization of environmental
ranges of species using traditional floristic habitat assignments.
This type of categorization derives from a large set of heuristics
that incorporate both abiotic (e.g. climate, soil and fire regime)
and biotic (e.g. herbivore pressure and community structure)
constraints and has been used by expert field botanists to identify and classify habitat types for >150 years. Therefore, this
approach has the advantages of incorporating extensive environmental information within a simple and falsifiable coding,
being easily accessible through floristic accounts (Daubenmire,
1966; Haufler et al., 1996). Based on this floristic labelling, we
classified species in seven categories (habitats) assumed to
have common abiotic (i.e. temperature and water availability)
and biotic (fauna) constraints. These habitats were coded with a
discrete value as follows: 0 ¼ arctic or alpine tundra; 1 ¼ deserts and semi-deserts; 2 ¼ cliffs and rock faces; 3 ¼ shrubland;
4 ¼ forests; 5 ¼ grasslands; 6 ¼ aquatic. Some taxa could not
be unambiguously assigned to a single habitat. In those cases,
the relative frequency of occurrence in each habitat type was
roughly quantified based on personal observations and using
floras and taxonomic treatments when possible, and incorporated in the analyses.

Rubio de Casas et al. — Habitat evolution in Saxifragales

Diversification across habitat boundaries

The relative rate of range expansion and habitat specialization of lineages that occurs in environmentally close habitats
was estimated with the GeoSSE (Geographic State Speciation
and Extinction) algorithm as implemented in diversitree
(Goldberg et al., 2011). The rate of per-lineage range expansion
from habitat i to habitat j is represented in GeoSSE by the parameter di, and can be taken as a proxy of the capacity of a lineage to spread across habitat boundaries. This parameter is
balanced by the per-lineage rate of extirpation within the opposite habitat xj. The difference between these parameters indicates whether lineages associated with a given habitat ‘i’
exhibit a greater tendency to spread into the neighbouring habitat ‘j’ (di – xj > 0) or to specialize within their ancestral habitat
(di – xj < 0; Goldberg et al., 2011).
We used GeoSSE to estimate the relative habitat specialization of lineages in every pair of habitats that were found to

have taxa in common, but focused on the five boundaries of
particular eco-evolutionary interest: forest/tundra, grassland/
forest, shrubland/forest, grassland/shrubland and shrubland/desert. Because GeoSSE models require that only two habitats be
present in the tree, the original dichotomized tree was pruned as
needed to leave only the data of the habitat pairs that were compared. GeoSSE analyses were run using an MCMC chain of
100 000 generations with a flat prior rate ¼ 01 and discarding
the first 2000 generations as burn-in. The significance of
GeoSSE results was assessed by determining the proportion of
samples from the posterior distribution for which a given result
holds, i.e. by estimating in how many samples of the posterior
the values of a parameter were within certain boundaries, for instance the proportion of posterior samples in which di – xj > 0.
All diversification analyses were corrected for incomplete phylogenetic sampling taking into account that only approx. 50 %
of the taxa were included (FitzJohn et al., 2009; Rabosky and
Goldberg, 2015).

RESULTS
Reconstruction of the ancestral Saxifragales habitat and habitat
evolution

The two most common habitats for Saxifragales are forest and
cliffs, each with approx. 300 species (30 % of the total; Table
1; Supplementary Data Table S1). However, forest was clearly
the most phylogenetically diverse, with 14 of the 15 families
represented (all but Penthoraceae). Conversely, desert and tundra habitats included only two families each and 10 % of the
species (Table 1). Most species could be unambiguously assigned to a single habitat, and only 113 species (approx. 12 %)
had to be assigned to two or more habitats simultaneously. Of
these, more than half were found to occur in forest (72 species), shrubland, grassland (61 secies each) or cliffs (49 secies;
Table 1). The milder environments (shrubland, forest and
grasslands) were thus found to have less specialized species
pools.
Ancestral state reconstructions (ASRs) by the three methods
(i.e. MkN and stochastic SIMMAP mapping with and without
polymorphic data) yielded similar results, with the differences
being more quantitative than qualitative. In every case, the
most likely ancestral habitat was forest, with early diversification into aquatic and desert habitats (Fig. 1; Table 1;
Supplementary Data Fig. S1). However, transitions from forest
into desert or into aquatic habitats were very rare, with median
rates of approx. 1  10–4 and approx. 2  10–4 per million
years, respectively (Supplementary Data Table S2). Although
these transitions might have taken place through a succession
of habitat states uncorrelated with extant diversity (e.g. Forest
! Tundra ! Cliff ! Desert; Fig. 1), these results underscore
that profound evolutionary consequences can derive from exceptional events. In general, MkN models resulted in mean
transition rates <001, the only exception being the transitions
out of tundra and into forest and cliffs habitats (Table 1; Table
S2). SIMMAP analyses showed that habitat transitions in and
out of forests and cliffs were relatively the most frequent (Table
1; Table S2), indicating that forest and cliff habitats might have
been crucial in the evolution of Saxifragales.

analysis of our data would have required the joint approximation of 245 parameters (all possible speciation rates for seven
habitat types and cladogenetic shifts between them: kiii; kiij;
kijj plus extinction and anagenetic change rates) with only 950
observations, which would have resulted in unreliable estimates. Thus, we restricted the analyses to allow each ancestral
lineage to produce only one daughter in a different habitat, i.e.
we only allowed for kiii; kiij to be approximated and fixed kijj
¼ 0.
To estimate the overall rates of anagenetic and cladogenetic
transitions into each habitat, we also constructed seven different
binary data sets in which taxa were considered to be either present or absent from each habitat, and ran ClaSSE analyses on
every data set. We also constrained kijj ¼ 0 in these new binary
state analyses to make the results comparable with the full
ClaSSE analyses. The posterior distribution of the parameters
was approximated with Bayesian inference running ten replicates of three MCMC chains of 10 000 generations on the dichotomized ML tree with exponentially distributed priors of
rate 01, 001 and 0001, respectively, and discarded the first
2000 steps as burn-in.
Additionally, we calculated the rates of speciation, extinction
and diversification across the whole tree and investigated
whether those rates differed across habitat types or lineages using BAMM (Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary
Mixtures) and BAMMTools (Rabosky, 2014; Rabosky et al.,
2014). The BAMM results were used to test for differences in
trait-dependent speciation, extinction and diversification using
the Kruskal–Wallis method in BAMMTools with parameters
calculated using 1000 iterations. Additionally, lineagedependent rates of the three parameters were plotted on the tree
to identify regions of the phylogeny associated with significant
changes in macroevolutionary rates. Because BAMM requires
a fully dichotomous tree with branches of length >0, we assigned all descendants of polytomies in the original tree a
branch length of 1/100 000 of the shortest, non-zero branch. We
conducted four independent runs of 1 000 000 generations and
assessed convergence among chains within and across runs using the logLik estimate provided by the software (Rabosky,
2014).

Habitat-dependent diversification

Taking diversification into account did not seem to alter
fundamentally the transition rate results. According to our
ClaSSE analyses, habitat transitions, whether anagenetic or
cladogenetic, are rare in Saxifragales (Fig. 2; Supplementary
Data Table S3). The highest rates were those leading from
tundra into forest, whether as the result of a diversification
event [cladogenetic habitat change (CHC), Table S3] or as an
adaptation (mean anagenetic transition from tundra to forest
0121 6 3  10–4 per million years). These two habitats appeared to have inverse within-habitat diversification patterns:
tundra lineages diversified at a very high rate, due to their
high speciation rates, whereas diversification in forest environments was very low, largely due to low speciation rates
(Fig. 2; Table S3). Tundra seems to be a cradle of recent diversity, while forest habitats appear to drain it (although forests do not seem to constitute a macroevolutionary sink in the
strict sense because their diversification rates are positive;
Fig. 2). The high diversity found in forests might be at least
caused by the recurrent adaptation or expansion of lineages
from other habitats, mostly tundra.

Our results also suggested that the cliff/rock faces habitat is
highly dynamic from a macroevolutionary standpoint, with the
highest rates of speciation, extinction and diversification.
Moreover, cliff lineages appeared to transition into forest at a
relatively high rate (Table S3). Conversely, diversification and
speciation appear to be rare in grasslands, whether within the
same habitat or associated with habitat shifts (Fig. 2; Table S3).
Grasslands were the only habitat with lower diversification
rates than forest, and they also seemed to be relatively easily
colonized (Fig. 2; Table S3). However, grassland lineages are
species-poor, whereas forest is the most species-rich habitat
(Table 1). Desert and aquatic habitats appeared to have comparable diversification patterns, in spite of their clear ecological
differences (Figs 1 and 2). These two habitats are relatively
species-poor, even though they have been occupied for a long
time. These small species pools are probably caused by the low
rates of within-habitat diversification and the rarity of lineages
from other habitats expanding their range into or adapting to
desert or aquatic habitats (Fig. 2; Table S3).
Shrubland is probably the most recently colonized habitat
in Saxifragales (Fig. 1; Fig. S1). Perhaps because of this short

habitat i spawn a daughter in a different habitat j; i.e. i¼jn kiij, and the rates of cladogenetic transition into habitat j are computed for each habitat as the kiij rate obtained collapsing the data set to a binary situation in which taxa can only be in habitat ‘i’ or in an alternative ‘non-i’ habitat ‘j’.

anagenetic transitions within lineages involving habitat shifts from (qi!) or towards habitat i (q!i). See text and Table S2 for details.

Macroevolutionary patterns of habitat shift

The GeoSSE results supported the hypothesis that in
Saxifragales most diversification occurs within habitats, and
that the rates of environmental range expansion are very low
(Fig. 3; Supplementary Data Fig. S3). In the focal ecotones, expansion in environmental tolerance (i.e. di – xj > 0) was only
found to be more likely than habitat specialization (i.e. di – xj <
0) in the tundra/forest and grasslands/forest boundaries (Fig. 3).
In these two cases, lineages in grasslands or tundra were significantly likely to expand their range into forests (posterior distribution of di – xforest values not including zero and non-

the rate of expansion out of the ancestral habitat (di) and the rate of extirpation in the alternative habitat (xj) for each pair of habitats i, j. Note that expansion of a lineage out of habitat i does not necessarily entail abandoning it, but that daughters of that lineage could potentially be present in both habitats, i þ j.

(Table S1; Figs S1 and S2). However, BAMM results were not
completely homogeneous, and intermediate diversification rates
could be observed in lineages associated with any habitat (e.g.
aquatic Myriophyllum, Halogaraceae; desert Adromischus,
Crassulaceae;
forest
Ribes
niveum–R.
divaricatum,
Grossulariaceae; arctic-cliff Saxifraga tolmiei–S. aprica,
Saxifragaceae). Nevertheless, extreme macroevolutionary rates
were closely associated with certain habitats: lowest in aquatic,
desert and forest habitats and highest in cliffs, shrubland and
tundra.

evolutionary history, the diversification rates of shrubland lineages were high, with frequent speciation and extinction
events (Fig. 2; Table S3). The results of BAMM analyses
also supported these overall results. Although BAMM did not
detect any significant difference in macroevolutionary rates
across habitats (P-values of 0158, 0473 and 0141 for speciation, extinction and diversification, respectively), plotting of
macroevolutionary rates on the tree revealed that the ancient
lineages associated with desert (e.g. Crassula deceptor–C.
deltoidea clade, Crassulaceae), aquatic (e.g. C. mataikona–C.
peduncularis clade) and forest habitats (e.g. Altingiaceae,
Hamamelidaceae) have the lowest speciation and diversification rates. The highest diversification rates were observed in
Crassulaceae and Saxifragaceae (Supplementary Data Fig.
S2). In the clade Graptopetalum paraguayense–Echeveria colorata (Crassulaceae), diversification appears to have taken
place within the ancestral cliff habitat. In the other two cases,
recent increases in diversification rates were accompanied by
the occupation of multiple habitats. In the Aeonium glandulosum–A. ciliatum clade (Crassulaceae), increased diversification rates resulted in daughters of a likely shrubland species
occupying desert and cliffs in addition to the ancestral
habitat.
In Saxifragaceae, the group Saxifraga bicuspidata–S. umbellulata diversified from a cliff-dwelling ancestor and produced

DISCUSSION
Habitat evolution in Saxifragales and diversification

Our reconstructions indicate that Saxifragales evolved from a
forest-inhabiting ancestor. Previous work indicated that the
MRCA of this group was probably woody and perennial (Soltis
et al., 2013). Peridiscaceae, the sister group to Saxifragales, is a
family of trees only found in tropical environments. In view of
this, a tropical forest tree or shrub might be posited as a probable ancestor of Saxifragales. Early diversification led to the colonization of desert and aquatic habitats (in the ancestors of
Crassulaceae and Halogaraceae), and then the occupation of
grasslands (e.g. by ancestral Halogaraceae) and cliffs (e.g. ancestral Saxifragaceae).
We stress, however, that the estimation of trait evolution on
phylogenies is prone to error (Mossel, 2003), and caution is
needed when interpreting the ASR results. For instance, our
analyses of habitat evolution might be mired by the lack of informative fossils. It is always possible that certain lineages
might have occurred in a given habitat but that the signal is not
retrieved computationally, a bias that can only be corrected
based on fossil evidence. Moreover, SIMMAP and MkN analyses did not take into account the incomplete sampling of extant
species (approx. 40 % of all Saxifragales), although this is

probably less limiting because sampling intensity was largely
consistent across the main clades. Notwithstanding these limitations, our results show clearly that the likelihood of a forest lineage spawning a desert or aquatic daughter is extremely small,
and yet these transitions appear to lie at the origin of the present
diversity of Saxifragales. These findings can be regarded as a
clear indication of the profound evolutionary consequences that
can derive from relatively unlikely events, such as the colonization of a new habitat.
Soltis et al. (2013) found that annual, herbaceous lineages
evolved early in Saxifragales. The results presented here indicate that those early transitions in growth form and life history
were accompanied by shifts in habitat. Modern desertinhabiting Crassula, Cotyledon and Tylecodon (Crassulaceae)
descend from herbaceous perennial lineages that colonized desert habitats, while lineages that resulted in modern aquatic
Crassula species appear to have always had an annual life history. This correlated conservatism of habitat types with other
traits such as life history might be partly responsible for the
generally low transition rates observed among habitat types.
Colonizing a new habitat might require significant changes in
the biology of a plant, including changes in life form and history (Zanne et al., 2014).
Tundra/alpine and shrubland seem to be the most recently
colonized habitats. However, tundra habitats have waned and
waxed, to the point of almost complete disappearance throughout Earth’s history. Therefore, tundra lineages might have appeared in the past and became extinct without leaving a
detectable trace in the phylogeny, especially since they seem to
have a high rate of extinction and to give rise to cliff and especially forest taxa. Alternatively, tundra and shrubland might
have been colonized more recently: Mediterranean shrubland
has an estimated age of 32–23 myr (Suc, 1984) while the
shrubland-like habitats (i.e. fynbos) in South Africa, which harbour many Saxifragales (e.g. Crassulaceae), are no older than 5
myr (Van Wyck and Smith, 2001). Modern tundra-like environments probably date to the Pliocene and are not older than 7
myr (53–26 mya; Graham, 2011; Brochmann et al., 2013).
Thus, our results might also reflect the relatively recent onset of
these habitats and their concomitant colonization by lineages
within Saxifragales.
The increased diversification associated with tundra and
shrubland is influenced by recent radiations in the Crassulaceae
(shrubland) and Saxifragaceae (tundra). In the former, the adaptive radiation of Macaronesian Aeonium resulted in a highly diverse clade with elements not only in shrubland but also in
desert and cliff habitats and that exhibit a wide variability in
growth form, life history and floral morphology (Jorgensen and
Olesen, 2001). The other recent radiation of chaparral
Crassulaceae in Graptopetalum species–Echeveria species appears to be associated with the evolution of perennial life forms.
Conversely, a rapid increase in diversification in Saxifraga was
concomitant with the transition into tundra habitats and the
emergence of annual, herbaceous life (Soltis et al., 2013).
These recent explosive radiations merit further investigation
and underscore the importance of tundra and shrubland habitats
in Saxifragales.
Additionally, tundra lineages appear to diversify relatively
easily into other habitats, namely forest. Rates of within-habitat
speciation appeared to be much higher than those resulting in

overlapping posterior distributions of di – xforest and dforest – xi;
Fig. 3). In general, forests are always more easily colonized
than any other alternative habitats with which they might have
taxa in common; there also seems to be a higher likelihood of
shrubland lineages to occupy forest than the reverse, although it
is not significantly different (dshrubland – xforest > dforest – xshrubland with 999 % posterior possibility, but posterior distributions
are negative and overlap zero; Fig. 3).
Similar results were retrieved in the comparisons of forest–
cliff and aquatic–forest habitat boundaries (Fig. S3). Grasslands
appeared to be more easily colonized from shrubland than the
reverse (dshrubland – xgrassland > dgrassland – xshrubland with 984 %
posterior probability; Fig. 3). Similarly, the desert–shrubland
comparison showed that lineages can transition into desert
more easily than out of it (dshrubland – xdesert > ddesert – xshrubland
with 990 % posterior probability; Fig. 3). However, this case is
ambiguous because the range expansion of desert lineages was
higher than that of shrubland lineages (mean ddesert ¼ 0022 6
34  10 –5; mean dshrubland ¼ 0004 6 10–5; and ddesert >
dshrubland with posterior probability ¼ 941 %), but this was
compensated by a significantly higher rate of extirpation in
shrubland (mean xdesert ¼ 0069 6 84  10–5; mean xshrubland
¼ 0173 6 11  10 –4; and xshrubland > xdesert with posterior
probability ¼ 995 %). Comparisons across other habitat boundaries further supported the prevalence of habitat specialization.
An increase in environmental range expansion was only supported for lineages transitioning from cliff to tundra (Fig. S3).
A potential sequence of diversification of Saxifragales lineages
might thus be cliff ! tundra ! forests. In fact, and although
cliff and tundra habitats were only reconstructed at relatively
recently nodes, several transitions from cliffs into tundra and
from either of these habitats into forests were detected in the
Saxifragaceae, Grossulariaceae and Crassulaceae (Figs S1 and
S2).

Rubio de Casas et al. — Habitat evolution in Saxifragales

Niche conservatism in Saxifragales

Rates of transition between habitats were generally very low,
indicating that habitat shifts either by range expansion or by adaptation to new conditions are rare. Moreover, the tendency of
clades to diversify within their ancestral habitats was the norm
for Saxifragales. Only cliff, tundra and grassland lineages exhibited a tendency to spread beyond their ancestral habitat, and
even in these cases the rates of habitat change were low. This
tendency to within-habitat speciation (i.e. cladogenetic specialization) matches the predictions of verbal and mathematical
models (Donoghue, 2008; Hua and Wiens, 2013). The association between lineages and their habitats constitutes an evolutionary contingency that leads to a correlation between
phylogeny and habitat. This pattern, generally termed niche
conservatism, has been posited as a general principle of evolution (Wiens et al., 2010). Our results indicate that the

association between certain lineages and habitats is very tight
in Saxifragales.
Shifts into tundra, and more particularly desert and aquatic
habitats, seemed particularly unlikely. These three habitats
were found to have the lowest rates of lineage diversification
into them, whether by cladogenetic or anagenetic shift.
Conversely, milder habitats such as forests appear to require a
lower degree of specialization. According to our data, many
taxa occur simultaneously in forest and other environments,
and the rates of cladogenetic range expansion and anagenetic
shift are highest for lineages expanding into or adapting to forests. Adaptation to the narrow environmental ranges characteristic of extremely arid, cold or aquatic environments entails
selection for a wide range of traits, including physiology, life
history and anatomy (Meinzer, 2003). Consequently, the gamut
of viable phenotypes may be limited and hard to evolve in taxa
from other environments.

Habitat shifts in Saxifragales

Habitat shifts are expected to be relatively rare, but of high
evolutionary consequence (Crisp et al., 2009; Donoghue and
Edwards, 2014). We focused our analyses on five habitat
boundaries that have been influential for the evolution of angiosperms and that are expected to be affected by global climate
change: forest/tundra, grassland/forest, shrubland/forest, grassland/shrubland and shrubland/desert. The forest/tundra boundary has been shaped by changes in treeline elevation and the
emergence of the current circumpolar flora during the Pliocene.
Many extant tundra taxa are believed to be the result of in situ
diversification or descendants of some Pliocene forest elements
(Murray, 1995; Comes and Kadereit, 2003; Brochmann et al.,
2013). In Saxifragales, tundra lineages appear to be the result of
a relatively high within-habitat diversification rate, and it is
more likely for tundra lineages to colonize forest environments
than the reverse. Similarly, we hypothesized that the transitions
from forests into grasslands or shrubland would be more likely
than the reverse, as these shifts had been described as important
for the evolution of several plant groups (Verdu et al., 2003;
Edwards and Smith, 2010; Bouchenak-Khelladi et al., 2010;
Goldberg et al., 2011). However, grassland and shrubland lineages appeared to generate forest taxa more easily than the opposite. Although it seems clear that shifts out of forests have been
fundamental for the macroevolution of angiosperms (after all,
Saxifragales themselves evolved ‘out of the forest’), our results
indicate that expansion into forest from other habitats is also
important evolutionarily, at least in qualitative terms.
Historically, changes in precipitation and fire regime have affected the distribution of the grassland/shrubland boundary
(Simon et al., 2009; Scheiter et al., 2012). Most grassland lineages appear to be derived from forest or shrubland ancestors,
maybe possessing adaptations associated with colonizing open
habitats that were crucial for their subsequent diversification
(Edwards and Smith, 2010; Lamont et al., 2013). In the case of
Saxifragales, it is hard to establish any clear trend, as the shrubland/grassland shift was not statistically supported in either direction. However, our results supported a shrubland to
grassland transition as the predominant trend in this clade.
Similarly, our data did not support any unambiguous trend in

cladogenetic habitat shifts (i.e. habitat colonization of a new environment by a daughter taxon), with the only exception of tundra. Simultaneously, diversification within the forest habitat
was particularly low. Nevertheless, this habitat contains the
largest number of taxa in our data set. This disparity between
diversification and actual diversity might be caused by the frequency with which lineages from other habitats spawn forest
taxa, both anagenetically and cladogenetically. Forest diversity
appears to be maintained by a frequent contribution from other
habitats coupled with low extinction rates.
Besides tundra and shrubland, cliffs provided the habitat
with the highest rates of diversification. Additionally, the number of species occurring in cliffs was the highest after forest.
Although it is hard to establish a clear causal agent for these
patterns, it might be associated with the ephemerality of rock
faces, which often collapse and erode, leading to frequent extirpation of populations and therefore increasing the probability of
extinction and genetic drift.
Cliffs and forest not only harbour the highest number of
species, but also seem to play a core role in diversification.
Although the rates of transition out of either of them are low,
their high diversity can in time generate daughter lineages
that colonize other habitats, compensating for the low probability of any single event. This mechanism might make cliffs
and forests ‘evolutionary hubs’ sensu Willis et al. (2014) that
facilitate habitat transitions and determine the overall diversification patterns of the group. Moreover, the two habitats
seem to be linked. Cliff lineages appear to expand into forests
at a relatively high rate. In the case of tundra, a role for high
latitudes as engines of diversification has been proposed for
other taxonomic groups such as birds and mammals (Botero
et al., 2014), although the reasons for this pattern are unclear.
It may be that taxa from highly seasonal environments (i.e.
tundra) or where extreme environmental fluctuations are frequent (i.e. cliffs) have a higher colonizing capacity because of
their broader environmental tolerances. In any case, the data
lead us to posit a scenario for the diversification of
Saxifragales consisting of a sequence in which lineages diversify first within cliffs or tundra and then expand into forest,
where extinction rates are very low.

Rubio de Casas et al. — Habitat evolution in Saxifragales
the case of the shrubland/desert boundary, but seemed to indicate that it might have been more likely for shrubland lineages
to shift into desert than the opposite. This result is in agreement
with patterns described in other systems (Crisp et al., 2009;
Heibl and Renner, 2012; Guerrero et al., 2013; although see
Lancaster and Kay, 2013). In spite of the limited statistical support, these patterns further underscore the importance of shrublands for the diversification of organisms that can later colonize
other habitats.

The evolution of Saxifragales appears to have been largely coupled with and influenced by habitat characteristics. Most diversification occurs within the ancestral ecological conditions;
hence, niche conservatism is of major evolutionarily importance
in this clade. Our results indicated that tundra, cliffs and shrubland habitats provide significant sources of diversification, while
forests play a central role in the diversification of this group by
providing an easily colonized environment with seemingly low
extinction rates. The expansion of lineages associated with tundra and grasslands into forests appears to have been particularly
significant in Saxifragales. Conversely, transitions into desert
and aquatic habitats are very rare, probably because these habitats are highly canalizing. Our results demonstrate that shifts
across habitat boundaries are in any case very rare and, consequently, any significant habitat loss or alteration such as those
expected under current rates of climate change will have dramatic macroevolutionary consequences for Saxifragales, potentially leading to the extinction of many lineages.
