 Dioecy, the sexual system in which male and female organs are found in separate individuals, allows greater specialization for sex-specific functions and can be advantageous under
various ecological and environmental conditions. However, dioecy is rare among flowering
plants. Previous studies identified contradictory trends regarding the relative diversification
rates of dioecious lineages vs their nondioecious counterparts, depending on the methods and
data used.
 We gathered detailed species-level data for dozens of genera that contain both dioecious
and nondioecious species. We then applied a probabilistic approach that accounts for differential speciation, extinction, and transition rates between states to examine whether there is
an association between dioecy and lineage diversification.
 We found a bimodal distribution, whereby dioecious lineages exhibited higher diversification in certain genera but lower diversification in others. Additional analyses did not uncover
an ecological or life history trait that could explain a context-dependent effect of dioecy on
diversification. Furthermore, in-depth simulations of neutral characters demonstrated that
such bimodality is also found when simulating neutral characters across the observed trees.
 Our analyses suggest that â€“ at least for these genera with the currently available data â€“
dioecy neither consistently places a strong brake on diversification nor is a strong driver.

Introduction
Sexual reproduction entails the union of a male gamete (sperm)
and a female gamete (egg), but in angiosperms the universality of
separate sexes at the gametophytic stage is coupled with a diverse
array of sexual systems at the sporophytic stage. Some species
have separate male and female sexes (dioecy), many species are
entirely hermaphroditic, and virtually every variant in between is
found (Supporting Information Table S1). Because of the high
degree of variability in sexual systems, flowering plants provide
an ideal group in which to conduct comparative evolutionary
analyses to understand the evolution of sexual systems. In particular, there is a long-standing interest in understanding why
dioecy is such a rare sexual system in flowering plants, present in
only c. 6% of the species (Renner, 2014) compared with c. 95%
in animals (Jarne & Auld, 2006). The rarity of a trait (here
dioecy) can be explained in a number of ways: it may slow speciation, hasten extinction, be slow to emerge from an ancestral state,
or disappear faster than it appears (Thomson & Brunet, 1990;
Schwander & Crespi, 2009).

Although rare, dioecy is believed to be advantageous as a
means to facilitate outcrossing, particularly when other outcrossing mechanisms are absent, thereby preventing inbreeding
depression (Thomson & Barrett, 1981; Thomson & Brunet,
1990). In addition, theoretical (Charnov, 1982) and empirical
studies (Ba~
nuelos & Obeso, 2004; Montesinos et al., 2006;
Tognetti, 2012) have shown that dioecy might be positively
selected because it dampens trade-offs between male and female
functions. Dioecy may also be selectively favored under certain
environmental conditions. For example, Muenchow (1987)
argued that dioecy may be favored in understory habitats where
nonspecific pollinators, which are often associated with dioecy,
tend to be found. Dioecious species have also flourished on the
Hawaiian islands, perhaps because dispersal among islands favors
long-lived tree species with fleshy fruits, both traits that are associated with dioecy (Schwander & Crespi, 2009).
Despite these potential advantages, species richness of dioecious
angiosperm clades is often lower than that of hermaphroditic sister
groups (Heilbuth, 2000; Kay et al., 2006). Dioecious lineages may
suffer a lower diversification rate for a number of reasons. Species

that are dioecious may be less able to colonize new sites because of
the need for a mating partner (Baker, 1955; Pannell & Barrett,
1998) or because seed production is restricted to the female half of
a population (Heilbuth et al., 2001; Wilson & Harder, 2003),
reducing opportunities for allopatric or parapatric speciation.
Reduced speciation rates may also result from the higher rates of
gene flow and subsequently lower population differentiation
among obligate outcrossers (Barrett, 2003). Alternatively, sexual
dimorphism driven by stronger sexual selection acting on males to
attract pollinators can place dioecious lineages at greater risk of
extinction, particularly when pollinator availability is fluctuating
(Vamosi & Otto, 2002). Indeed, a survey of the International
Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species
revealed that dioecious families are enriched for species at risk
(Vamosi & Vamosi, 2005), thus hinting that dioecy is associated
with elevated extinction risk, at least under present conditions.
Furthermore, dioecious lineages tend to exhibit a suite of correlated traits, including abiotic pollination, biotic dispersal,
woody growth form, tropical distribution (Renner & Ricklefs,
1995; Vamosi et al., 2003; Vamosi & Vamosi, 2004), and to
some extent polyploidy (Miller & Venable, 2000; Ashman et al.,
2013), which in turn may affect their evolution. An analysis of
transition rates to dioecy in angiosperms found little support
overall for the idea that dioecy is more prone to evolve in lineages
that have a woody growth form, tropical distribution, plain flowers, or fleshy fruits than in those lacking them (Vamosi et al.,
2003). Rather, there was more support for the hypothesis that
correlations between dioecy and ecological traits are caused via
differential net diversification (i.e. speciation minus extinction)
of dioecious lineages when associated with the aforementioned
traits (Vamosi & Vamosi, 2004). Furthermore, these correlations
with other traits may themselves impact diversification. For
example, the lower diversification rates of dioecious lineages
could be explained by an association with polyploidy, a trait that
also exhibits lower diversification rates at the genus level (Mayrose et al., 2011).
Previous comparisons of diversification rate of dioecious lineages vs their nondioecious counterparts were based on sisterclade contrasts at the genus and family levels (Heilbuth, 2000;
Kay et al., 2006). While sister-clade comparisons have been
widely used in comparative evolutionary studies to reveal a character that is associated with altered diversification rates (Mitter
et al., 1988; Farrell et al., 1991; de Queiroz, 1998), this method
cannot differentiate between effects of a trait on speciation vs
extinction, making it difficult to understand the underlying
mechanism. In addition, sister-clade contrasts discard phylogenetic information both internal and external to the sister clades
and assume only a single trait transition differentiating the two
sisters (but see Heilbuth, 2000). Furthermore, a recent analysis
demonstrated that sister-clade comparisons can be strongly biased
when the derived state has fewer species because the waiting time
until the derived state first appears reduces opportunities for
diversification in that state (Kâ‚¬afer & Mousset, 2014). Notably,
using a resampling test that should correct this problem, Kâ‚¬afer &
Mousset (2014) reanalyzed the data of Heilbuth (2000) and concluded that dioecy does not lead to lower net diversification and

may, if anything, increase it. This reanalysis assumed, however,
that the most recent common ancestor of each sister-clade pair
was nondioecious and ignored extinctions, assumptions that
would overcorrect the bias. In a subsequent study, Kâ‚¬afer et al.
(2014) used an updated data set, including only those sister
clades where dioecy was inferred to be the derived state. Using
the corrected sister-clade method of Kâ‚¬afer & Mousset (2014), the
authors reached a similar conclusion, namely, dioecy tends to
increase diversification. Kâ‚¬afer et al. (2014) suggested that the rarity of dioecy may instead be attributable to frequent losses of
dioecy, which contradicts the classic view that the evolution of
dioecy is largely irreversible (Bull & Charnov, 1985; but see Barrett, 2013). Thus, as fundamental as sexual systems are to
angiosperm biodiversity, we currently do not understand why
dioecious lineages are rare.
Recent developments in comparative phylogenetic methods
allow the simultaneous estimation of rates of speciation and
extinction, as well as transition rates between states, within a likelihood framework (Maddison et al., 2007; FitzJohn et al., 2009;
FitzJohn, 2012). These methods require phylogenetic trees with
known trait states for extant taxa, although complete phylogenetic sampling and trait information are not required (FitzJohn,
2012). One important caveat is that these likelihood methods
only reveal a correlation between a particular trait and speciation
or extinction rate (Maddison et al., 2007) and do not show causation. In particular, even if other factors underlie variation in
diversification rate, a statistically significant association between a
trait and diversification can be obtained if transitions in the trait
happen, by chance, to cause a trait state to be associated with a
more diverse portion of the tree (FitzJohn, 2012; Maddison &
FitzJohn, 2015). Consequently, these methods could suffer from
an elevated false-positive rate when analyzing a single clade as a
result of processes that were unaccounted for in the model (Rabosky & Goldberg, 2015). In order to avoid such coincidental
associations, Rabosky & Goldberg (2015) suggested performing
comparative analyses on multiple data sets, drawing conclusions
based on a preponderance of evidence (Mayrose et al., 2011; Rolland et al., 2014).
To this end, we gathered data on sexual systems in many taxonomic groups (largely genera) that contain both dioecious and
nondioecious species (Tree of Sex Consortium, 2014). In this
study, we assembled molecular phylogenies for dozens of genera
for which we had detailed sexual system information. This
allowed us to investigate the consequences of dioecy for rates of
speciation and extinction using the binary state speciation and
extinction (BiSSE) likelihood method (Maddison et al., 2007;
FitzJohn, 2012). The inferred speciation and extinction rate
parameters for dioecious and nondioecious taxa were then compared across genera to determine whether dioecy has a consistent
effect on diversification. We further examined whether differences in ecological and life history traits accounted for the
observed variation in diversification patterns among these groups.
Moreover, we examined whether the diversification rate of dioecious lineages was significantly correlated with the form of the
nondioecious taxa (primarily hermaphroditic or primarily
monoecious), given that some of the advantages of dioecy may be

shared by monoecious species (reduced inbreeding and an elimination of trade-offs at the flower level between male and female
function; Barrett, 2002, 2003). Finally, we conducted extensive
simulations to reveal the distribution of the relative diversification rates of dioecious lineages expected for a â€˜neutralâ€™ trait, given
the observed trees and transition rates. We close by discussing
additional factors that may affect the observed patterns, including
limitations of the current data sets.

Materials and Methods
Database
A broad data set of angiosperm sexual systems was assembled as
part of a working group sponsored by the National Evolutionary
Synthesis Center, with a focus on 77 genera exhibiting both the
presence and absence of dioecious species (Tree of Sex Consortium, 2014). The genera used in the current study were chosen
largely from the list of angiosperm genera that contain dioecious
species (Renner & Ricklefs, 1995) and supplemented with genera
analyzed by Miller & Venable (2000), focusing on groups with
sufficient genetic data in GenBank (Benson et al., 2013).
While ideally all sexual systems would be considered separately, doing so in a diversification analysis leads to a large number of parameters (speciation and extinction rates for each sexual
system, as well as all possible transition rates). We thus grouped
together different sexual systems to obtain a manageable number
of model parameters. Specifically, we classified the wide array of
possible sexual systems (Table S1) into binary categories, using
two different classifications. For â€˜strict dioecy,â€™ we compared
dioecious lineages against all other sexual systems which exhibit
at least partial cosexuality (i.e. classifying gynodioecy, androdioecy, and polygamodioecy apart from dioecy). For â€˜broad
dioecy,â€™ we grouped all systems with some unisexual plants (including dioecy, gynodioecy, androdioecy, and polygamodioecy),
in contrast to the â€˜bisexualâ€™ state where both sexes are found on
every plant (hermaphrodites and all forms of monoecy). In addition, the resulting data set was filtered to genera for which the
reconstructed phylogeny included at least 10 species and at least
two species in each state (dioecy and nondioecy). Taxonomic
name resolution was largely performed using The Plant List
(v.1.1; http://www.theplantlist.org/). We also employed synonymy provided by experts in particular groups (notably
Solanaceae Source; http://solanaceaesource.org). The resulting
data set included 38 genera in the â€˜strictâ€™ classification and 41 in
the â€˜broadâ€™ classification (Table S2).
Phylogenetic reconstruction
The phylogeny for each genus was reconstructed using the following general procedures. (A detailed description of the steps is provided in Methods S1). Sequence data for all species in the genus
were automatically retrieved from GenBank (Benson et al., 2013)
using National Center for Biotechnology Information taxonomy.
This was followed by a name resolution procedure that matched
species names as they appear in GenBank to accepted taxonomic

names (according to The Plant List and Solanaceae Source).
Sequences were then clustered to orthology groups using
ORTHOMCL (Li et al., 2003). An appropriate outgroup was chosen
and then added to each cluster. The sequences in each cluster were
then aligned, filtering out unreliably aligned sequences and positions and then concatenated into one multiple-sequence
alignment. Next, ultrametric phylogenetic trees were reconstructed with MRBAYES v.3.2.1 (Ronquist et al., 2012), using the
best-fitting nucleotide substitution model inferred for each locus
based on MRAIC (Nylander, 2004; https://www.abc.se/~nylander/mraic/mraic.html). Trees were pruned to remove taxa whose
position in the tree was highly uncertain (listed in Table S3). To
account for phylogenetic uncertainty, our diversification analyses
used 100 trees sampled from the Bayesian posterior distribution.
All alignments and phylogenies are available in DRYAD (http://
dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.7f4v1/1).
Diversification analysis
With both the strict and broad classification schemes, we estimated diversification rates for dioecious (D) and nondioecious
(N) lineages using the BiSSE model (Maddison et al., 2007) as
implemented in the diversitree R package (FitzJohn, 2012). Six
parameters were simultaneously estimated for each genus: the
transition rates from N to D (qND) and from D to N (qDN), the
speciation rates of lineages in states N and D (kN and kD, respectively), and extinction rates for lineages in states N and D (lN
and lD, respectively). Using these estimates, the difference
between speciation and extinction rate provides the net diversification rate for each state (rN = kN lN and rD = kD lD). We
note that extinction rates are difficult to estimate and are particularly sensitive to sampling biases (Rabosky, 2010; but see
Beaulieu & Oâ€™Meara, 2015). However, the net diversification
rate, which is the primary focus of our analysis, does not rely on a
precise estimate of the extinction rate and accounts for correlations between speciation and extinction. Nevertheless, we complemented each diversification analysis with one in which the
BiSSE model is constrained to enforce equal extinction in both
states. Our analyses were performed using the â€˜skeletalâ€™ tree
approach (FitzJohn et al., 2009), which accounts for the sampling
fraction of species in the given phylogeny out of the total number
of species in the clade. Sampling fraction estimates were calculated based on the number of species in a genus as obtained
through a literature search (see references in Table S2). To assess
the sensitivity of our results to the assumed fraction of sampled
species, we also used the total number of accepted and unresolved
species from The Plant List (v.1.1; http://www.theplantlist.org/),
which on average yields twice the number of species (Table S2);
this second analysis generated extremely similar results, so only
the results using the number of species in the genus reported in
the literature are given here.
A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling approach
described in FitzJohn et al. (2009) was used to estimate the posterior probability distributions for each of the six parameters,
accounting for uncertainty in parameter estimation, incomplete
sampling, and phylogeny. An exponential prior distribution was
Ã“ 2015 The Authors

used for each parameter (see next paragraph for more details).
For each of the sampled trees, MCMC chains were started at the
maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters and were
run for 2000 steps with the first 10% discarded as burn-in. The
MCMC results of all 100 trees for each genus were combined
together. To test whether extinction and speciation rates differ
between sexual systems, while accounting for uncertainty in the
tree and in the transition rate parameters (qND and qDN), we calculated for each genus the proportion of BiSSE MCMC steps
(i.e. the posterior probability (PP)) in which a given rate (i.e. k, l
or r) was higher for nondioecious lineages than for dioecious
lineages. For example, PP(rN > rD) is the proportion of postburn-in steps in which nondioecious lineages were inferred to
diversify at a higher rate than dioecious lineages. (Simulations
reported in Fig. 6 of FitzJohn et al. (2009) indicate that PP
(rN > rD) does not differ significantly from 50% when diversification rates are trait independent and that this measure is able to
detect trait-dependent diversification.)
To examine the robustness of the MCMC results, each genus
was subjected to three different MCMC analyses, each with a different prior distribution. Results that are sensitive to the prior
choice suggest that the data for that group lack sufficient information to overcome the prior. Specifically, three different exponential prior distributions for each parameter were examined.
First, we used the starting.point.bisse function of diversitree to fit
a trait-independent model (assuming sexual system does not
influence diversification) to obtain initial parameter estimates for
the speciation (k0), extinction (l0), and transition (q0) rates.
Given these estimates, three different prior distributions were
obtained for each parameter by setting the mean of the prior distribution to p 9 f, where f = 1, 2, 4 and p is the estimated rate
parameter (i.e. for speciation rates we obtained three exponential
priors by setting the mean of the exponential distribution to k0,
2k0, and 4k0). Genera were not considered robust and were
excluded (see Table S2) if PP(rN > rD) values differed by > 20%
across the different priors. We report the results obtained using
f = 2, the prior rate value that was suggested by FitzJohn et al.
(2009) (all results are available at DRYAD http://dx.
doi.org/10.5061/dryad.7f4v1/1). To assess significance over the
whole data set, we used a one-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test
with a mean equal to 50%, testing the null hypothesis that diversification rates in the D state should be higher than those in the
N state half of the time, treating the PP value of each genus as a
single data point. In addition, we used Hartigansâ€™ dip test (Hartigan & Hartigan, 1985) to test whether there was significant evidence for multimodality in the PP distribution.
We further examined whether the inferred diversification rate
differences between dioecious and nondioecious clades were correlated with various ecological or life history traits: growth form
(woody vs herbaceous), pollination mode (biotic vs abiotic),
dispersal mode (biotic vs abiotic), and geographical distribution
(tropical vs temperate). These other traits were coded based on
the genus level categorization of Renner (2014). For growth
form, Renner (2014) only specified presence/absence of trees,
shrubs, herbs, or climbers, and many of the genera contained
both woody and herbaceous species. To determine whether the

genus was predominantly woody or herbaceous, we gathered
species-level life form data from the literature (Tree of Sex Consortium, 2014), supplemented with data from Zanne et al.
(2014) and data collected from EFLORA (Brach & Song, 2006).
Genera that are mostly (â‰¥ 70%) woody or herbaceous were
defined as such. Genera exhibiting a mixture of the growth forms
(with no one state above 70%) were excluded from the particular
comparison. For geographical distribution, the database of Renner (2014) specified whether the genus is distributed in tropical
and/or temperate regions. Again, genera distributed in both tropical and temperate regions were excluded from the particular
comparison. In addition to the life history traits described earlier,
we also examined whether the types of nondioecious species present in a genus are associated with the inferred diversification
rates. We categorized genera in which the nondioecious state is
mostly (â‰¥ 70%) hermaphrodite as â€˜Mostly Hâ€™; genera with mostly
(â‰¥ 70%) monoecy were labeled as â€˜Mostly Mâ€™; all other genera
were dropped from this analysis. For each categorization,
we assessed whether support for a diversification rate difference
(PP(rN > rD)) differed significantly from 50% using a one-sample
Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
Simulations
Estimation of diversification rates could be influenced by additional factors other than the trait of interest (here sexual system),
leading to an elevated false-positive rate (FitzJohn, 2012;
Rabosky & Goldberg, 2015). Thus, we used a parametric bootstrapping approach to obtain the null distribution of the relative
diversification rates expected for each genus. Specifically, we
compared our observed data against simulated data obtained by
tracking the evolution of neutral characters (assuming no effect
on diversification) on the same set of empirically derived phylogenies. For each genus, we drew a single tree from the posterior
set, to represent the true phylogenetic relationships. Using this
tree and the known sexual systems of the tips, we estimated the
two transition rates (from and to dioecy) and the probability of
the root being in each of the two states according to the full sixparameter BiSSE model using a short (200 steps) MCMC chain.
We then simulated binary traits along the tree using a Markov
model whose only parameters were the estimated transition rates
(mk2 model implemented in the package diversitree; FitzJohn,
2012) and starting from an ancestral state drawn randomly from
the root state probability distribution. Thus, these simulations
assumed no direct effect of the character on speciation or extinction. Similar to the analysis of the true data, we kept only simulated data sets that included at least two tips of each state,
repeating the procedure until 100 data sets were obtained. The
simulated state data were then subjected to the same BiSSE
MCMC procedures as the original data, conducted on 20 other
trees from the posterior distribution (not all 100, to reduce computation time). We used the distribution of simulated
PP(rN > rD) values to calculate a per-genus P-value as the proportion of simulated values that are as extreme as the observed
PP(rN > rD) for that genus. A P-value < 0.025 or > 0.975 can be
interpreted as significant support for the hypothesis that the

The diversification results using â€˜broadâ€™ and â€˜strictâ€™ classifications,
with and without constraining extinction rates, are summarized
in Table 1. Because these analyses yielded similar results (Figs 1,
2, S1, S2; distributions of relative speciation, extinction and transition rates are shown in Fig. S3), we focus here on the results of
the â€˜broadâ€™ classification (which includes more genera) without
constraining extinction rates. Of the 41 genera considered within

To date, the most comprehensive database detailing the taxonomic distribution of dioecy was first compiled by Renner &
Ricklefs (1995) and recently updated (Renner, 2014). The latest database lists 987 genera in which dioecious species are
known to exist, c. 1/3 of which vary in sexual system within
the genus. This database is not suitable for detailed comparative phylogenetic analysis because sexual system assignments
are given at the genus rather than species level. To this end,
we summarized the Tree of Sex database of species-level sexual
system assignments for angiosperm genera with variation in
sexual system: 38 genera were included in the â€˜strictâ€™ classification and 41 in the â€˜broadâ€™ classifications. The â€˜strictâ€™ classification includes 475 dioecious and 1535 nondioecious species,
whereas the â€˜broadâ€™ classification includes 663 species with unisexual plants and 1676 consisting of bisexual plants only
(Table S2). In total, the reconstructed phylogenies of these
genera include 3380 species and cover on average 42% of the
recognized species in these groups.

Results

the â€˜broadâ€™ classification, preliminary BiSSE runs indicated that
the results for five data sets were highly dependent on the exact
prior choice and were thus deemed unreliable. Dropping these
genera, our final data set consisted of 36 genera, whose reconstructed phylogenies encompassed 2702 species (Table S2). Fig. 1
presents the distribution of PP(rN > rD) values with each genus
represented by the value inferred across the sample of 100
Bayesian trees. (The per-tree PP(rN > rD) values, as well as the
raw distributions of rN and rD, for each genus are shown in
Fig. S4). Our results indicate that dioecious lineages do not consistently diversify at higher or lower rates compared with nondioecious lineages (that is, PP(rN > rD) did not deviate
significantly from 50%, P = 0.17; one-sample Wilcoxon ranksum test). However, the distribution exhibited significant
bimodality (P < 0.048; Hartigansâ€™ dip test). Approximately 67%
of the genera exhibited higher diversification in the dioecious
state (with four genera showing PP(rN > rD) < 2.5%), while 33%
exhibited lower diversification (with three genera showing
PP(rN > rD) > 97.5%). The number of genera in the extremes of
these two tails (seven) represents a significant excess over the 5%
expected (exact binomial test; P = 0.0018). The posterior

Because the percentage of the rare state could influence diversification estimates, we analyzed an additional and independent set
of simulated data sets in which simulated data sets were kept only
if the percentage of tips within each state differed by < 10% from
that observed in the original data. We denote these two
approaches as â€˜free tip frequencyâ€™ and â€˜matched tip frequencyâ€™.

distribution of rN > rD was unimodal for most genera, as was the
distribution of PP(rN > rD) across the trees for a genus (Fig. S4).
This consistent signal from each genus indicates that the analysis
was robust within and among the sampled trees. Rather, the
bimodality arose because dioecy was correlated with higher diversification in some genera and lower diversification in others (see
the Simulations and sampling issues subsection below for evidence that this bimodality might reflect other unknown processes
affecting the shape of the trees).
Overall, the posterior probabilities for diversification rate differences, PP(rN > rD), were highly correlated with those inferred
for speciation rate (PP(kN > kD): r = 0.93; P < 10 10; n = 36) but
not for extinction rate (PP(lN > lD): r = 0.07; P = 0.7), suggesting that diversification rates inferred for these genera generally
reflected inferred rates of speciation. Furthermore, PP(rN > rD)
values were not correlated (P = 0.7) with the transition rates
asymmetries (i.e. PP(qND > qDN)), suggesting that the apparent
pattern of diversification is not driven by biased transition rates
between the sexual systems.
Results were fairly similar using the â€˜strictâ€™ definitions of
dioecy. Of the 38 genera, seven were filtered out based upon
sensitivity to the prior, leaving 31 genera. The mean of the
PP(rN > rD) distribution did not deviate significantly from 50%
(P = 0.13; one-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Again, the distribution exhibited a bimodal pattern (Fig. 1b), but the bimodality was not significant according to Hartigansâ€™ dip test (P = 0.18;
Dn = 0.07), possibly because of the smaller sample size. In addition, one genus displayed PP(rN > rD) < 2.5% and two displayed
PP(rN > rD) > 97.5%, which represents a slightly higher density
in the tails, but not significantly so (P = 0.2; exact binomial test).
Results were similar when constraining the extinction rates to
be equal (lN and lD), suggesting that the known difficulty in
accurately estimating extinction rates (Rabosky, 2010) does not
influence the conclusions using either â€˜strictâ€™ or â€˜broadâ€™ classifications (Table 1; Fig. S1). In all four analyses (â€˜strictâ€™ or â€˜broadâ€™
classifications, with and without constraining the extinction
rates), genera with more nondioecious species tended to display
higher PP(rN > rD) values (Fig. S5), as expected whether or not
sexual system truly influences diversification rates (e.g. when by
chance dioecy happens to be overrepresented in a clade, higher
rD will be inferred and vice versa). Note that several clades have
very skewed tip ratios (very low or high percentage dioecy), which
strongly limits the power of BiSSE (Davis et al., 2013).
Trait correlations
We tested whether the high degree of variation observed in
relative diversification rates for dioecious and nondioecious
lineages (Fig. 1) could be attributed to differences among the
genera in certain ecological and life history traits (i.e. testing
whether dioecy does affect diversification rates but only in the
background of another trait). Specifically, we subdivided the genera according to whether they were predominantly herbaceous
or woody, temperate or tropical, animal dispersed or abiotically
dispersed, animal pollinated or abiotically pollinated, or
primarily hermaphroditic or monoecious when considering the

nondioecious species. As shown in Fig. 2, we did not find any
significant associations between the relative diversification rates
of dioecious lineages and the analyzed traits (all P-values above
0.27).
Simulations and sampling issues
To examine whether our results could be explained solely by elevated false positives from the BiSSE methodology (FitzJohn,
2012; Rabosky & Goldberg, 2015), we used neutrally simulated
traits to construct a null hypothesis of the distribution of
PP(rN > rD) on our empirically derived phylogenies. The results
were amalgamated into a single histogram for visualization
(Fig. 3), although one must keep in mind that these points are
based on the same 36 genera and hence are not fully independent. Interestingly, the PP(rN> rD) distributions were strongly
bimodal under the two simulated scenarios (â€˜free tip frequencyâ€™
or â€˜matched tip frequencyâ€™), resembling the distribution obtained
for the empirical data set (Fig. 1). Considering the simulated distributions within each genus separately (Figs S6, S7), it is apparent that the distribution was not bimodal in most genera but
rather peaked near either the right or left tail of the distribution,
leading to an overall bimodality pattern across the genera, as for
the true sexual system states. We next sampled 100 data sets,
choosing one inferred PP(rN > rD) from one simulated data set
per genus, thus creating a background distribution for our metaanalysis, and calculated bimodality using two different metrics.
In both cases, we found that the bimodality exhibited by the
empirical data was not significantly different from the bimodality
expected by chance among the simulated data sets. First, the
observed density of data points in the two extreme tails (PP
(rN > rD) < 0.025 or > 0.975) fell within the distribution found
in the simulated data sets (Fig. 3b,e). Second, the simulated data
sets typically showed bimodality, with a significant dip test statistic in 66 (â€˜free tip frequencyâ€™) or 88 (â€˜matched tip frequencyâ€™) out
of 100 simulated data sets. Again, the observed data fell well
within the distribution of simulated test statistics (Fig. 3c,f).
While the shapes of the observed phylogenetic trees often lead
randomly generated characters to exhibit evidence for differential
diversification (high or low PP(rN > rD) values), the observed data
suggested a stronger effect of dioecy on diversification for some
genera than expected based on the distribution of simulated characters. Specifically, for each genus, the empirically derived
PP(rN > rD) values were compared to the 100 simulated data sets
(Figs S6, S7 for â€˜free tip frequencyâ€™ and â€˜matched tip frequencyâ€™).
Given that only 100 simulations were performed, a strict multiple corrections test could not be performed, but we focused only
on those observed results that fell outside of the full range of the
100 simulations. With the â€˜free tip frequencyâ€™ approach, dioecy
is inferred to have a more positive effect on diversification than
100% of the simulated characters for Dodonaea, Fragaria,
Galium, and Sidalcea and a more negative effect for Pilea
(Fig. S6). Of these, the effect of dioecy on diversification remains
significantly different from that for the simulated characters only
for Fragaria and Sidalcea with the â€˜matched tip frequencyâ€™
approach (Fig. S7). Using the strict definition of dioecy, dioecy

Each panel presents both â€˜broadâ€™ (left side) and â€˜strictâ€™ (right side) classifications. Horizontal and vertical lines mark the sample means and  SE,
respectively. For each particular trait, we tested whether the mean of the PP(rN > rD) distribution was different from 50% using a one-sample Wilcoxon
rank sum test. All P-values were nonsignificant, with P > 0.27. In addition, we did not find any significant difference between the PP(rN > rD) of the two
states of each trait (e.g. between woody and herbaceous) using a two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test.

was only found to have a negative effect on diversification (in
Gunnera and Pilea with the â€˜free tip frequencyâ€™; Pilea with the
â€˜matched tip frequencyâ€™). Thus, focusing on genera that are atypical relative to the simulation results, dioecy did not have a consistent effect on diversification, and the direction of effect was not
related to other traits putatively purported to influence diversification (e.g. woodiness or tropical distribution). Furthermore,
even these genera might not have appeared unusual if we had
accounted for uncertainty in the transition rates within the simulated data sets.
However, poor sampling may have also reduced our power to
detect departures from neutrally simulated characters. In line
with this idea, there was a significantly negative correlation between PP(rN > rD) values and the percentage of species within a
genus included in the tree (r = 0.53; P = 0.001). Indeed, the

taxa with the most complete sampling (Sidalcea, Allocasuarina,
Fraxinus, Momordica, Rhus, Dodonaea, Fragaria, and Lepechinia,
each with > 60% sampling on the phylogeny) tended to support
higher diversification of dioecious clades, and all exhibited
PP(rN > rD) values below 50% (0.6, 3.9, 8.8, 10.1, 10.7, 12.7,
14.6 and 19.7%, respectively). This suggests that there might
indeed be some clades where dioecy significantly impacts diversification and that increased sampling would improve our power to
detect these clades.

Discussion
Here, we asked whether dioecy affects diversification rates by
applying probabilistic phylogenetic methods to a large set of genera with both dioecious and nondioecious species. We found no

consistent effect of dioecy on diversification. Instead, we observed
a mixed pattern, with dioecious lineages sometimes exhibiting
higher diversification and other times showing the reverse, and
we showed that this pattern could be explained by chance. Our
results are in line with those of several other studies that used similar methods in other plant groups and did not detect a strong
effect of sexual system on diversification rates (Leslie et al., 2013;
McDaniel et al., 2013; Villarreal & Renner, 2013). Villarreal &
Renner (2013) found no difference between the diversification
rates of monoicous and dioicous species applying BiSSE to a 98
species (out of 200) phylogeny of hornworts. Using a large
conifer phylogeny and the BiSSE model, Leslie et al. (2013)
found no effect of sexual system (monoecy or dioecy), cone type
(dry or fleshy), or their combination on diversification rates.
McDaniel et al. (2013) used a genus-level phylogeny of 493 moss
genera and found only a nonsignificant trend towards higher
diversification for hermaphrodites over dioecious species. Our
analysis extends these previous studies by examining multiple
clades simultaneously and conducting comprehensive simulations
to evaluate the significance of the results.

While low power may have limited the fraction of clades
with extreme diversification rate asymmetry (in the tails of the
PP(rN > rD) distribution), it cannot explain why there was substantial and significant bimodality in the effect of dioecy on
diversification. Two different explanations could account for the
observed bimodality. The first possibility is that dioecy does have
a direct impact on diversification, but only when coupled with
certain other traits (e.g. woody dioecious lineages might diversify
at higher rates, but not herbaceous dioecious lineages). Our comparisons of diversification rates in the background of different
ecological and life history traits revealed no association of the relative diversification rates with the various ecological or life history
traits examined (growth form, pollination mode, dispersal mode,
and geographical distribution). This conclusion contrasts with
that of a previous study (Vamosi & Vamosi, 2004) which found
that dioecious sister clades were relatively more speciose when
associated with tropical distribution, woody growth form, plain
flowers, and fleshy fruits. This difference in outcome might be
attributable to the relatively small number of genera in our study,
differences in methodology, and/or differences in the taxa

considered. Indeed, across the 994 genera in which dioecy is present (Renner, 2014), we found a significant difference in pollination and dispersal modes between genera that are entirely
dioecious and genera that have multiple sexual systems. Fully
dioecious genera are more associated with wind pollination
(P = 0.025; v2 = 35; chi-square test) and animal dispersal
(P = 0.03; v2 = 20), suggesting that the set of genera analyzed
here does not perfectly represent the entire set of genera in which
dioecy is present.
The second â€“ and very likely â€“ possibility is that the observed
bimodality reflects other factors not included in our analysis that
affect diversification rate, such as a different trait (e.g. geographical range) or temporal changes in speciation and/or extinction
rate (FitzJohn, 2012; Rabosky & Goldberg, 2015). Dioecy may
then, by chance, be associated with lineages exhibiting higher or
lower diversification. The wide taxonomic distribution of dioecy
allowed us to use a meta-analysis of multiple independent data
sets to test this hypothesis. We used simulations of neutral character states to obtain the null distribution expected for our metaanalysis given the same set of empirically derived phylogenies.
We found that such bimodal distributions would be expected by
chance. Whatever these unexamined factors may be, we conclude
that the effect of dioecy on diversification is not strong enough or
consistent enough to have imparted a signal in the data analyzed.
We emphasize that several aspects of the data may have limited
the power of our analyses and/or potentially biased our conclusions. First, on average only 42% of species within each genus
were included (between 7 and 100% per genus). Although simulation studies showed that such coverage allows detection of differential diversification rates with only modest reductions in
power (FitzJohn et al., 2009), greater sampling within genera
would have improved our ability to detect the effects of dioecy.
Second, we assumed that the sampling fraction was the same for
dioecious and nondioecious taxa, which might well be incorrect
(e.g. if dioecious species are considered unusual and hence more
often investigated and sequenced). However, for each genus, the
fraction of dioecious species included on the trees (i.e. with
GenBank data) was highly correlated with the fraction of dioecious species in the Tree of Sex database (Tree of Sex Consortium, 2014) (r = 0.94; Pearson correlation coefficient; Fig. S8).
That said, species whose sexual system was not specified in our
search of the literature would be missing from both data sets. In
particular, many authors might not mention if a species is
hermaphroditic, given how common this sexual system is among
flowering plants. Underreporting of hermaphroditism might
artificially bias our results towards higher diversification of dioecious lineages. Third, we used only genera that contain at least
two species of each sexual system. We may thus have preselected
genera with higher than average origination rates and/or diversification rates of the derived state (dioecy for most of our genera). Moreover, by including only genera with both dioecious
and nondioecious taxa (as required by BiSSE), a large number
of clades that are entirely dioecious were ignored (e.g. nearly
half of all dioecious angiosperm species are found within 34
clades that are entirely dioecious; Renner, 2014). Ideally, one
should use the complete angiosperm phylogeny (or multiple
New Phytologist (2016) 209: 1290â€“1300
www.newphytologist.com

large-scale phylogenies) in which the sexual system distribution
is representative of angiosperms as a whole. This, however, requires
much higher coverage of sexual system information as well as
methodologies that can appropriately handle the greater computational demands and biological heterogeneity of very large phylogenies. Fourth, our results may have been affected by the somewhat
artificial nature of the binary classifications that we made. That
said, we observed very similar results for the â€˜strictâ€™ and â€˜broadâ€™ classifications, even though the â€˜broadâ€™ classification contains c. 30%
more dioecy species than the â€˜strictâ€™ classification.
Considering all of the potential biases discussed earlier, our
result that dioecy is not consistently associated with either
increased or decreased diversification must be considered preliminary and deserving of further research. We hope that that the
issues we have highlighted in obtaining these results will aid such
further investigation.
Conclusions
A quarter of a century ago, Thomson & Brunet (1990) reviewed
several hypotheses to explain the rarity of dioecy within flowering
plants. These authors challenged, although could not reject, previously proposed correlations and hypotheses for the distribution
of dioecy among angiosperms. The authors concluded that only
with detailed phylogenetic analysis could these hypotheses be
confirmed or rejected. Twenty-five years later, despite detailed
investigations in several clades (Renner et al., 2007; Volz & Renner, 2008), no phylogenetic study has examined more than a
handful of plant groups, preventing general conclusions from
being drawn. Even though we amassed the largest detailed data
set to date and carried out careful and detailed phylogenetic analyses, we did not find a consistent effect of dioecy on diversification. Our analysis suggests that the effect of dioecy on speciation
and extinction rates, if there is one, is relatively weak and easily
overwhelmed by other factors affecting diversification. That is,
dioecy does not consistently act as a strong driver of or brake on
diversification. However, the possibility remains that future
research, with more complete data and potentially improved
methods, will clarify whether sexual systems affect rates of speciation and extinction in flowering plants.
