The relationship between range and diversiﬁcation is an enduring evolutionary question. The rich angiosperm
diversity stems from several factors including variations in geographical distribution and ﬂoral morphology,
which tend to correlate with diﬀerent pollinator preference in many taxa. Pollinator diversity varies among
diﬀerent regions, thus range shifts can play an important role in increasing divergence by predisposing clades to
ﬂoral shifts. Antirrhineae is an ideal model to examine the eﬀect of range shifts and pollination modes on
diversiﬁcation, because the tribe is distributed in the Old World and the New World with representatives
exhibiting hummingbird pollination in the New World, and bee pollination in the Old World and the New World.
Using ancestral reconstructions and phylogenetic modeling, this study investigated the eﬀects of geographic
distribution and pollination modes on the macroevolution of the tribe Antirrhineae. Our age-range correlation
analysis showed young nodes had more range overlap than older nodes in the phylogeny, suggesting sympatric
speciation as a contributing factor to the diversiﬁcation of the tribe. We observed similar rates of diversiﬁcation
throughout time with no evident rate shifts within the tribe. Old World and New World lineages have similar
speciation rates in Antirrhineae, and pollination mode did not have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the diversiﬁcation of
the tribe. However, we found evidence for increased diversiﬁcation rates through long-distance dispersal events,
which occurred between the Old World and the New World four times throughout the evolutionary history of
Antirrhineae. Therefore, we conclude that long-distance dispersal was a strong contributor to the diversity
within Antirrhineae.

1. Introduction

Underlying these biotic inﬂuences on diversiﬁcation, such as plantpollinator interactions described above, geographical isolation presents
another strong force on diversiﬁcation (Anacker and Strauss, 2014).
The geographical extent of a clade has a signiﬁcant impact on its
diversity, and it is shaped by several factors including geological
processes such as continental drift, glaciation, and mountain formation;
the clade's ecological niche; and dispersal events (Wiens and Donoghue,
2004). When species are exposed to diﬀerent environmental factors
upon a range shift, they often become subject to diﬀerent selective
forces, favoring a diﬀerent set of characters than the ones in their
previous environment (Sexton et al., 2009). Previous studies have
found many factors may increase diversiﬁcation rates in a lineage upon
dispersal into a new region (Moore and Donoghue, 2007). The biotic
factors for a plant lineage include the exposure of the species to new
ecological niches (Linder, 2008), or simply the lack of competitors in
the new region (Sexton et al., 2009). Abiotic factors include a more
favorable climate decreasing the environmental stress on the species,
thus reducing the risk of extinction caused by harsh environments

With over 300,000 species, angiosperms form an extraordinarily
species-rich group. This exceptional diversity has generated a wealth of
explanatory mechanisms, many of which are not mutually exclusive
(Dodd et al., 1999; Chase et al., 2010; Vamosi and Vamosi, 2011;
Armbruster, 2014; Tank et al., 2015). Early theories of diversiﬁcation of
angiosperms posited that reproductive features involved with seed
production and dispersal were key factors in the evolutionary success
of angiosperms (Stebbins, 1981). It has also long been suggested that
interactions between ﬂowering plants and pollinators contribute to this
diversity (Stebbins, 1981; Kiester et al., 1984; Armbruster, 2014; Forest
et al., 2014; Van der Niet et al., 2014). These interactions include
lineage splitting in angiosperm taxa due to pollinator shifts (Forest
et al., 2014); pollinator-mediated ﬂoral trait divergence and reproductive isolation (Van der Niet et al., 2014); and evolutionary success of
angiosperm taxa associated with specialized pollination systems (Hu
et al., 2008; Armbruster, 2014).

angiosperm diversity hotspots (Thompson, 2005), the Mediterranean
Basin has the highest Antirrhineae diversity and abundance in the
world (Ogutcen and Vamosi, 2016). In the New World, most of the
Antirrhineae taxa are concentrated in the California coast, which also
has a Mediterranean climate. Bee pollination is the most common
pollination mode in Antirrhineae both in the Old World and the New
World, but hummingbird pollination is also observed in several genera
in the New World (Elisens and Freeman, 1988).
The wide range of geographical distribution patterns and diﬀerent
pollination modes make Antirrhineae a useful group to study the
relationship between long-distance dispersal and pollination in macroevolution, and to understand whether changes in the environment
triggers speciation and trait evolution. Using phylogenetic comparative
methods, we aim to (i) quantify the evolutionary rate heterogeneity
within Antirrhineae to determine whether any taxa experienced
diﬀerent rates than the rest of the tribe; (ii) test whether range overlap
increases or decreases with time since divergence within the tribe; and
(iii) examine the eﬀects of geographical distribution and pollination
syndrome on diversiﬁcation rates. We hypothesize that transitions from
bee to hummingbird pollination, which promotes reproductive isolation
thus facilitating sympatric speciation, may be an important factor in
Antirrhineae diversiﬁcation upon dispersal from the Old World to the
New World.

(Cracraft, 1985). Alternatively, allopatric speciation may be facilitated
by the availability of fragmented heterogeneous microhabitats in the
new environment (Hughes and Eastwood, 2006). It was recently shown
that high diversiﬁcation rates in angiosperms are correlated with
dispersal into new regions (Uribe-Convers and Tank, 2015). One of
the key traits associated with increased speciation rates in angiosperms
is biotic pollination (Dodd et al., 1999). This is suggested to be due to
reproductive isolation facilitated by the visitation of diﬀerent pollinator
groups (Kay and Sargent, 2009). The diversity of functional groups of
pollinators varies in diﬀerent regions; making the likelihood that
diversiﬁcation is increased when dispersal is accompanied by exposure
to new suites of pollinators, particularly when there is selection for
pollinator specialization.
Changes in the composition or abundance of pollinators have been
shown to promote angiosperm radiation (Kiester et al., 1984) through
shifts toward alternate pollinators or a reduce reliance of pollinators
(Foxe et al., 2009). Plants can be pollinator generalists that attract a
broad range of visitors, or pollinator specialists that attract a narrow set
of visitors (Waser et al., 1996). If the specialized pollinator is the most
abundant or the most eﬃcient pollinator in the area, specialization can
be advantageous for plants (Waser et al., 1996). Shifts between
specialized systems can promote speciation in ﬂowering plants
(Hardy and Otto, 2014). In several angiosperm clades, shifts from bee
to hummingbird pollination have been observed in the New World
(Beardsley et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2007; Lara and Ornelas, 2008),
and pollinator shifts were associated with high rates of diversiﬁcation
both in the New World (Kay et al., 2005; Schmidt-Lebuhn et al., 2007),
and the Old World (Forest et al., 2014).
Depending on the geographic distribution of pollinators, range shifts
in plant lineages may be accompanied by shifts in pollination mode.
Bees are the most common pollinators in the world, and they were
estimated to have originated in the early to mid-Cretaceous, which also
corresponds to the early diversiﬁcation of the angiosperms (Danforth
et al., 2006). Hummingbirds on the other hand, experienced a late
diversiﬁcation about 22 mya in South America, and expanded their
geographic range to North America and to the Caribbean relatively
recently (McGuire et al., 2014). When compared to the bees as a broad
functional group that has a worldwide distribution, hummingbirds have
a more narrow distribution, limited to the New World (Bleiweiss,
1998). Hummingbirds are eﬀective pollinators with high visual ability
and long-term memory, and they are capable of ﬂying long distances,
especially in adverse weather conditions when bees are unable to serve
as eﬀective pollinators (Cronk and Ojeda, 2008). However, the
advantages of hummingbird pollination come with a cost, as hummingbird pollinated plants tend to have showy ﬂowers with large volumes of
dilute nectar (Pacini et al., 2003; Cronk and Ojeda, 2008). The costs and
beneﬁts of each functional group of pollinators make for greater
potential for speciation via pollinator shifts (Forest et al., 2014).
It was previously assumed that the allopatric speciation events
represent the dominant speciation mode (Futuyma and Mayer, 1980),
but more studies show non-allopatric speciation modes are also
common, especially in plants (Savolainen et al., 2006; Grossenbacher
and Whittall, 2011). Reproductive isolation is necessary for sympatric
species to generate and maintain enough divergence to prevent gene
ﬂow large enough to lapse back into a single species (Rieseberg and
Willis, 2007). In many cases, closely-related species are isolated by
multiple reproductive barriers (Chari and Wilson, 2001). Nonrandom
mating due to pollinator preference is a common reproductive isolation
mechanism that can facilitate sympatric speciation in ﬂowering plants
(Kiester et al., 1984; Sexton et al., 2013; Forest et al., 2014; Ferris et al.,
2014; Van der Niet et al., 2014).
With 27 genera representing 240 species (The Plant List; http://
www.theplantlist.org), Antirrhineae Dumort. is one of the larger tribes
under the family Plantaginaceae Juss (Albach et al., 2005). Antirrhineae has a cosmopolitan distribution, and the tribe is represented in the
Old World and the New World (Fig. 1). As one of the biggest

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Taxon sampling and phylogenetic analyses
We recently generated an extensive phylogeny of Antirrhineae
(Supplementary Figure S1; Ogutcen and Vamosi, 2016). Out of 240
species from 28 genera within the tribe (The Plant List; http://www.
theplantlist.org), we sampled 146 species (61% coverage) from 24
genera. Node ages were inferred using an uncorrelated lognormal
relaxed clock, and the tree was calibrated using the divergence between
Cheanorhinum and Linaria (mean of 23 million years ago with the
standard deviation of 4 million years) estimated in a previous study
based on fossil data (Bell et al., 2010). We used the Maximum clade
credibility (MCC) tree generated from the Bayesian analysis of ﬁve
molecular markers (ITS, ndhF, rbcL, rps16, and trnL-F) in all the analyses
in this study (see Ogutcen and Vamosi, 2016 for further details about
the phylogenetic reconstruction of the tribe).
2.2. Age-range correlations
We collected occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity
Information Facility (GBIF) database (www.gbif.org). We excluded
duplicate records, records with missing coordinates, and those having
coordinates with less than two signiﬁcant digits after the decimal. We
also removed the data points that were outside the native range of a
species. After these quality control procedures, we had with 104,318
geographic coordinate data points for 80 out of the 146 species
represented in the current phylogeny (55% coverage). Data points
were visualized on a world map using the R package ggmap (Kahle and
Wickham, 2013). We calculated age-range correlations with the
Fitzpatrick-Turelli algorithm (Fitzpatrick and Turelli, 2006) using an
R script provided by Dena Grossenbacher (University of Minnesota;
Turelli et al., 2014). The environmental data were scaled to 1 km2.
After generating a geographic range overlap matrix, we used a twotailed permutation test (Fitzpatrick and Turelli, 2006) to assess the
signiﬁcance of the correlation between the node age and the geographic
range overlap.
In order to detect regional diﬀerences in age-range correlations, we
also analyzed the Old World and the New World taxa separately.
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to determine whether the
degree of age-range overlap was diﬀerent between the two regions. We
set range overlap as the dependent variable, age as the continuous

size for the MCMC cycles were higher than 200 in order to ensure each
run reached convergence to equilibrium. Using the posterior probability of changes in speciation rates within the phylogeny, we generated a
set of rate shift conﬁgurations, which account for the 95% of the
probability of the data. We selected the conﬁguration with the highest
posterior probability to determine the number of rate shifts within the
tribe, and examined the rate through time plot to observe the speciation
rates through evolutionary time.

covariable, and region (Old World versus New World) as the categorical
factor. In order to estimate the function of the regression without
making an a priori assumption that there is a linear relationship
between age and range overlap, we also employed nonparametric
regression using locally weighted polynomial regression (LOESS)
method (Fox and Weisberg, 2011). We performed Analysis of variance
(ANOVA) to determine whether the regression lines for the Old World
and the New World were diﬀerent when compared to each other and to
the overall regression line within the tribe.

2.4. Ancestral state reconstruction for pollination
2.3. Evolutionary rate analysis
We collected pollination data from various resources based on direct
observations, historical surveys, and occasionally, inferences from
ﬂoral morphology and pollinator community within the studied region
(see Appendix A; Proctor and Yeo, 1973; Elisens, 1985, 1986; Elisens
and Freeman, 1988; Sutton, 1988; Kampny, 1995; Ghebrehiwet et al.,
2000; Fernández-Mazuecos et al., 2013). Bee pollination is the more
common pollination mode in the tribe, and bees also visit many
“hummingbird pollinated” species. For simplicity, we categorized
pollination data into two groups: bee pollination and hummingbird
pollination. The bee pollination category represents species that are

We used the Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures
(BAMM; Rabosky, 2014) program to examine the rates of evolution,
and to determine whether the evolutionary rates vary among the clades.
In order to account for incomplete taxon sampling, we set the global
sampling fraction to 0.61 (146 out of 240 species in Antirrhineae). We
executed the speciation/extinction analysis using MCMC simulation
with 10,000,1000 generations, and used the R package BAMMtools
(Rabosky et al., 2014) to visualize and analyze the BAMM data. We
used the R package coda (Plummer et al., 2006) to conﬁrm the eﬀective

taxon sampling corrections based on diﬀerent assumptions: (iii) in the
“realistic” setting, pollination mode was kept consistent throughout a
genus (i.e., if a single pollination mode is observed in the genus, then all
the species within the genus were assumed to have the same pollination
mode. Alternatively, if there are both bee and hummingbird pollination
within a genus, then the ratio of bee:hummingbird pollination was kept
constant); (iv) in the “more bee” setting, all the unknown pollinators in
the New World were assumed to be bee, (v) in the “less bee” setting, all
the unknown pollinators in the New World were assumed to be
hummingbird; and (vi) in the “all NW bird” setting, all New World
species are assumed to be hummingbird pollinated, even if they are
observed to be bee pollinated. Two more assumptions were made for all
the state-dependent settings: (i) All Old World species are bee pollinated; and (ii) two species that were not in the phylogeny (Mabrya
coccineae and Mabrya geniculata) are hummingbird pollinated (assumption based on Elisens, 1986).

visited only by bees, whereas the hummingbird pollination category
represents species that are visited by hummingbirds and also by bees to
some extent.
In order to characterize the pollination history of Antirrhineae, we
performed ancestral state reconstructions in Mesquite 3.03 (Maddison
and Maddison, 2014). We performed both unordered maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) reconstruction. For the ML
reconstruction with Markov-k state 1 model, we denoted the presence
of hummingbird pollination as 1, and exclusive bee pollination (no
hummingbird pollination) as 0.
2.5. Trait-dependent diversiﬁcation analyses
In order to determine the diﬀerences in speciation and extinction
rates within the Old World and the New World, we used the “GeoSSE”
function (Geographic State Speciation and Extinction; Goldberg et al.,
2011) within the R package diversitree (FitzJohn, 2012). We listed
species under two categories: New World distributed (A) and Old World
distributed (B). The parameters were: speciation within New World
(sA), speciation within Old World (sB), between-region speciation
(sAB), extinction from New World (xA), extinction from New World
(xB), dispersal from New World to New World (dA), and dispersal from
Old World to New World (dB). Our sampling was unbiased in terms of
the ratio of the Old World species to the New World species. Old World
and New World species represent 78% and 22% of our phylogeny
respectively. This ratio is comparable to the ratio of the whole tribe
(77% Old World species, 23% New World species).
Next, we examined how pollination mode correlates with diversiﬁcation rates in Antirrhineae using the “BiSSE” function (Binary State
Speciation and Extinction; Maddison et al., 2007) within the R package
diversitree (FitzJohn, 2012). We coded bee pollination as 0, and
hummingbird pollination as 1. We estimated speciation rates in taxa
with both traits (λ0, λ1), extinction rates in taxa with both traits (μ0,
μ1), and character state shift rates from one trait to another trait (q01,
q01). We tested constrained models with (i) equal speciation rates
(??1 = ??0), (ii) equal extinction rates (??1 = ??0), and (iii) equal
character state shift rates (??10 = ??01) to test the eﬀects of pollination
mode on diversiﬁcation. We performed an ANOVA to determine
whether the eﬀects of diﬀerent pollination modes on diversiﬁcation
were signiﬁcant.
In order to examine the eﬀects of incomplete sampling (FitzJohn
et al., 2009), we ran the analysis using six diﬀerent settings: (i) in the
“original” setting, the available pollinator data was used without
incomplete taxon sampling correction; (ii) in the “phylo” setting, we
used the available pollinator data was used with incomplete taxon
sampling correction independent of the character states of the missing
taxa. The following settings incorporate state-dependent incomplete

3. Results
3.1. Age-range correlations in Antirrhineae
Age-range correlation analysis showed a signiﬁcant decrease in
range overlap over time in Antirrhineae (p = 0.0100; Fig. 2, Table 1).
When examined separately, both the Old World and the New World
taxa showed negative age-range correlations, but they were not
signiﬁcant (p = 0.572 and p = 0.144 respectively; Fig. 2, Table 1).
The regression lines for the Old World and the New World taxa are
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from each other (ANCOVA, p = 0.0149; Table 1),
with the New World taxa having a steeper decrease in range overlap
(r = −0.00083) than the Old World taxa (r = −0.00076) over time.
However, non-parametric regression analysis showed no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence between the Old World and the New World Antirrhineae
(p = 0.0998; Table 1).
3.2. Speciation rates in Antirrhineae
Antirrhineae experienced a slow increase in speciation rates through
time (Fig. 3). BAMM analysis revealed three possible conﬁgurations for
the speciation rate shifts within the tribe (Fig. 3): the no rate shifts
conﬁguration was the most probable one (f = 0.72), followed by the
conﬁguration where Lafuentea had decreased speciation rates
(f = 0.15) and the third conﬁguration where the rest of the tribe (with
Lafuentea as an outgroup) had increased speciation rate (f = 0.071).
3.3. Geographical distribution and pollination mode in Antirrhineae
Out of 146 species in the phylogeny, we retrieved pollinator data for

ﬂowers (Fig. 6). In Gambelia-Galvezia lineage, a switch from purple to
red ﬂowers was observed along with a bee to hummingbird transition at
the ancestral node. The splitting of bee-pollinated Schweinfurthia
papilionaceae from its sister species Gambelia speciosa was coupled with
a red to yellow transition. Lophospermum-Mabrya lineage was observed
to have similar transitions; a purple to red transition at the base, and a
red to yellow transition at the node splitting Mabrya acerifolia (the only
hummingbird pollinated species with yellow ﬂowers) from its sister
species Lophospermum scandens. In Sairocarpus-Galvezia lineage, however, purple remained the ﬂoral color for the hummingbird-pollinated
Sairocarpus species, but Galvezia juncea had a switch from purple to red.

97 of them (Supplementary Table S1). 85 species are bee pollinated
(58%), 12 are hummingbird pollinated (8%), and the rest of the taxa
had no pollination data available (34%; Fig. 4). In terms of geographic
distribution, 112 of the 146 species were distributed in the Old World
(78%), whereas 22 species were distributed in the New World (22%). In
examining the distribution of predominant pollinators in the two
geographic regions, we ﬁnd that bee pollination was observed in
100% of the Old World species, and hummingbird pollination was
observed in 44.44% of the New World species.
3.4. Ancestral pollination mode in Antirrhineae
The ancestral pollination mode was inferred to be bee pollination in
both MP and ML ancestral state reconstruction analyses (bootstrap
value: BS = 93.68%; Fig. 5) Antirrhineae experienced three switches
from bee to hummingbird pollination (Fig. 5): (i) Gambelia-Galvezia
lineage (BS = 53.67%) between 24.69 and 12.35 mya, (ii) Lophospermum-Mabrya lineage (BS = 99.44%) between 11.71 and 7.29 mya, and
(iii) Sairocarpus-Galvezia lineage (BS = 97.04%) between 9.77 and 5.98
mya. One hummingbird to bee pollination transition was observed
within the Gambelia-Galvezia lineage, when the bee pollinated species
Schweinfurthia papilionaceae split from its sister species Gambelia
speciosa 8 mya (Fig. 5). The ancestor of these two sister species were
inferred to be hummingbird pollinated (BS = 53.49%).
When the ﬂoral color transitions are examined, the switches from
bee to hummingbird pollination were mostly accompanied by changes
from purple to red ﬂoral color (data not shown). Out of 12 hummingbird-pollinated species, nine of them have red-dominant (crimson, red,
magenta; collectively called red from now on) ﬂowers, one has yellowdominant (cream, yellow, brown, orange; collectively called yellow
from now on) ﬂowers, and two have purple-dominant (pink, mauve,
lilac, violet, purple, blue; collectively called purple from now on)

3.5. Trait-dependent diversiﬁcation patterns in Antirrhineae
GeoSSE analysis showed the speciation rates in the Old World were
not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from that in the New World (p = 0.426;
Table 2, Fig. 7). Between-region speciation rates were higher than
within-region speciation rates, and dispersals between the Old World
and the New World had signiﬁcant eﬀects on diversiﬁcation within the
tribe (p = 0.00914; Table 2). Overall extinction rates were inferred to
be low, and the New World extinction rates were shown to be zero.
Dispersals were only observed from the Old World to the New World.
No signiﬁcant diﬀerence in extinction or dispersal rates between the
two regions was observed (Fig. 7).
In terms of the eﬀects of pollination mode on diversiﬁcation rates,
BiSSE analysis showed that the rates of speciation, extinction, and
character shifts were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between bee pollinated
and hummingbird pollinated lineages in Antirrhineae, and that employing diﬀerent settings that incorporated the potential for sampling bias
did not have any eﬀect on the results (Table 3).

4. Discussion

uous spectrum (Butlin et al., 2008), and several cases of non-allopatric
speciation have been documented in a variety of taxa including ants
(Savolainen and Vepsäläinen, 2003), birds (Sorenson et al., 2003),
palms (Savolainen et al., 2006), and monkeyﬂowers (Grossenbacher
and Whittall, 2011). However, because geographic ranges can shift over
time, the geographic speciation mode can be obscure (Anacker and
Strauss, 2014), and making once sympatric species currently allopatric
(Graham and Lundelius, 1984), or vice versa (Berlocher, 1998).
Throughout its evolutionary history, Antirrhineae has experienced four
independent cross-continent dispersal events (Ogutcen and Vamosi,
2016), which might inﬂuence the correlation between time since
divergence and range overlap. These ancient splits that have zero range
overlap will skew the analysis to have the signature of sympatric
speciation, and mask the inﬂuence of allopatric speciation in the tribe.
The presence of Antirrhineae is very dense in Europe, where the most
recent glaciation eradicated plant communities in the North, forcing
them to shift their ranges to the South in the Quaternary Glacial Period
(Takhtajan, 1969). These historical range shifts and local extinctions

4.1. Sympatric versus allopatric speciation in Antirrhineae
The observed trend that younger nodes have more geographic
overlap than older nodes suggests that sympatric speciation may be a
signiﬁcant factor shaping the evolutionary history of Antirrhineae.
Because chromosome count changes are common in Antirrhineae
(Ogutcen and Vamosi, 2016), sympatric speciation may be facilitated
by chromosome count changes acting as a reproductive barrier. While
Antirrhineae has also experienced a number of long-distance dispersal
events (Ogutcen and Vamosi, 2016), which contributed to allopatric
speciation, our analysis reveals that allopatric speciation alone is
unlikely to account for all the speciation events in the tribe.
For a long time, allopatric speciation was accepted to be the main
mode of geographic speciation, and sympatric speciation remained a
controversial concept (Mayr, 1942; Coyne and Orr, 2004). It recently
became clear that geographic speciation is not bimodal, but a contin44

large contributors to Antirrhineae diversiﬁcation. Upon entering into a
new region, a clade may experience increased sympatric speciation
rates due to the availability of new niches to exploit within the region,
but the rates will gradually decrease, because fewer niches will be
available to ﬁll (Coyne and Orr, 2004). However, testing this hypothesis
is diﬃcult, because diversiﬁcation rates are determined not only by
speciation rates, but also by extinction rates. Unfortunately, measuring
extinction rates can be diﬃcult, especially when working with extant
taxa that have no fossil record. For this reason, extinction rates usually
tend to be underestimated, and this underestimation skews diversiﬁcation rates (Etienne and Apol, 2008; Rabosky, 2010; Stadler and Bokma,
2013). In Antirrhineae, the estimated extinction rate is zero in the New
World, and very low in the Old World. Therefore, “high” diversiﬁcation
rates may be an artifact of underestimated extinction rates. Overall,
GeoSSE results suggest between-region speciation is the major factor in
the Plantaginaceae diversiﬁcation, whereas regional diﬀerences in
diversiﬁcation are not signiﬁcant.

may also skew the age-range correlation within the tribe, masking the
true speciation mode in the region. In addition to these factors
explained above, undersampling can be another source of error.
“Absence” of a species in a particular region can either mean the area
is not within the species’ range, or simply the species has not been
sampled in that area. Finally, as previously discussed by other authors
(Phillimore et al., 2008; Hodge et al., 2013). The age-range analysis is
accurate only when one mode of speciation is dominant, but most
clades experience a mixture of diﬀerent geographic speciation modes
throughout their evolutionary history, making the majority of agerange analysis results inconclusive (Bolnick and Fitzpatrick, 2007).
Therefore, whereas it is still worthy to note the signiﬁcant impact of
sympatric speciation on the diversiﬁcation of Antirrhineae, the assumption that sympatric speciation is the dominant speciation mode in the
tribe should be approached cautiously.

pollination as the ancestral pollination mode in the tribe, which was
expected, as it is the most common pollination mode in Antirrhineae,
and the origin of the tribe was the Old World (Ogutcen and Vamosi,
2016), where hummingbirds are absent. There were three transitions
from bee to hummingbird pollination, all of which occurred shortly
after the long-distance dispersals from the Old World to the New World.
The switches in the Lophospermum-Mabrya and Sairocarpus-Galvezia
lineages have high support values (BS > 95%). In contrast, the bee to
hummingbird switch in the Gambelia-Galvezia lineage has a lower

insect orders Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera, and
the hummingbird family Trochilidae. We focused on bee versus
hummingbird pollination, because (i) it is the main diﬀerence between
the Old World and the New World in terms of pollination modes, and
(ii) they are the two pollination modes with the most reliable data.
Other pollinators (e.g.: beetles, butterﬂies, ﬂies) are only documented
as “visitors” in very few studies (Guzman et al., 2015), and it is not well
known whether they are eﬀective pollinators. Similar to previous
studies (Ghebrehiwet et al., 2000), the current study inferred bee

support value (BS = 54%), which could be due to the presence of a beepollinated species (Schweinfurthia papilionacea) within the lineage. S.
papilionacea experienced a transition from hummingbird to bee pollination, which was in conjunction with the long-distance dispersal event
from the New World to the Old World. Therefore, our ﬁnding supports
that transition from bee to hummingbird pollination is not an irreversible process (Tripp and Manos, 2008).
In Antirrhineae, transitions from bee to hummingbird pollination
were often, but not always, accompanied by changes from purple to red
ﬂowers. Switching from purple to red ﬂoral color has generally been
observed to be the more common direction than the reverse due to the
biochemical nature of the anthocyanin production (Zufall and Rausher,
2003). Transitions from purple to red are known to be associated with

the inactivation of one or more stages in the anthocyanin production
pathway (Rausher, 2008). This transition is virtually irreversible,
because restoring purple pigment production would involve simultaneous gain-of-function mutation of several genes in the pathway (Zufall
and Rausher, 2003). Previous studies have shown correlations between
red ﬂowers and hummingbird pollination (Schemske and Bradshaw,
1999; Rausher, 2008). Considering our ﬁnding that red color is not
universal in hummingbird-pollinated species, and that all hummingbird
pollinated species with red ﬂowers are nested within purple-ﬂowered
clades, a pattern that has been shown to be the case in many other
clades (Zufall and Rausher, 2003; Rausher, 2008; Thomson and Wilson,
2008), we posit that hummingbird pollination in Antirrhineae likely

evolves in clades with purple ﬂowers and red pigmentation evolves
subsequently.
We did not perform a correlation analysis between ﬂoral color and
pollination modes, because some of the pollination data retrieved for
this study were inferred from pollination syndromes (Elisens, 1985,
1986; Elisens and Freeman, 1988), which would give false positive
correlation between the two traits. It is also important to note that
whereas most of the hummingbird pollinated Antirrhineae species have
red ﬂowers, this is not always the case. Some hummingbird-pollinated
species are purple (e.g.: Sairocarpus multiﬂorus, Sairocarpus virga), and
some red ﬂowered species are not pollinated by hummingbirds (e.g.:
Linaria amoi). It is important to note that bees are able to see red, and
that red ﬂoral color does not exclude bees as visitors (Chittka and
Waser, 1997). These observations suggest that the pollination modes
inferred solely by pollination syndromes should be approached with
caution, as previously discussed (Waser et al., 1996; Ollerton et al.,
2009).

2005). With spatial and environmental heterogeneity, unique geological properties, and inﬂuences from its surrounding ﬂoras, the Mediterranean region hosts rich plant diversity (Thompson, 2005). Therefore,
dispersing to a diﬀerent environment may not be advantageous for the
Mediterranean clades, because they have traits that are likely adapted
for Mediterranean conditions. Most Antirrhineae species have ﬂoral
traits that are often linked to bee-pollination. The features of typical
Antirrhineae ﬂowers include zygomorphy, tubular corollas enclosed by
a lip, and nectar containing spurs (Ghebrehiwet et al., 2000; Guzmán
et al., 2015). Considering the high frequency of these bee-pollination
related traits within the tribe, hummingbird pollination may not be
advantageous to a clade that migrated from a bee-dominant region.
The emergence of hummingbird pollination in the New World from
bee pollinated Old World ancestors in the Mediterranean was relatively
recent in the tribe. Therefore, instead of specializing in hummingbird
pollination, The New World Antirrhineae species may simply incorporate hummingbirds into their pollinator suite and become more
generalist. Depending on the strength and eﬃciency of reproductive
barriers, sympatric speciation may take a long time, and pollinator
preference may be an insuﬃcient mechanism to establish and maintain
reproductive isolation between the two sympatric populations (Van der
Niet et al., 2014). It was previously shown that pollinator preference
alone is usually not strong enough to maintain reproductive isolation,
and that additional mechanisms may be necessary to form an eﬀective
reproductive barrier between the two diverging populations (Gegear
and Burns, 2007; Armbruster, 2014). It would be interesting to
investigate hummingbird-pollinated species at population levels to see
whether they show any signatures of population structure hinting at
early stages of speciation, and if they do, research should focus on
whether there are other modes of reproductive isolation along with
pollinator preference to facilitate speciation.

4.4. Trait-speciﬁc diversiﬁcation rates in Antirrhineae: adding pollination
into the picture
Pollinator preference promotes reproductive isolation at varying
degrees, which may facilitate speciation in ﬂowering plants in sympatry. Following this rationale, we hypothesized that after dispersing to
the New World, switches from bee to hummingbird pollination may
increase reproductive isolation among the New World clades, thereby
increasing sympatric speciation rates in Antirrhineae. However, pollinator shifts in either way do not seem to have an appreciable eﬀect on
diversiﬁcation in Antirrhineae. Our results are in contrast to other
studies that have shown increased diversiﬁcation rates upon switching
to hummingbird pollination in neotropical clades (Perret et al., 2003;
Barfuss et al., 2005; Kay et al., 2005). It was hypothesized that
hummingbirds have originated in the neotropics, and they still have a
strong presence in this New World biodiversity hotspot (Bleiweiss,
1998; Rymer et al., 2010). On the other hand, Antirrhineae is
predominantly an Old World tribe, and they are densely distributed
in the Mediterranean Basin, which is another biodiversity hotspot.
During the last glacial period, the Mediterranean Basin served as a
refugium for many plant species, and the landmasses in the area have
split up and merged several times throughout the history (Thompson,

5. Conclusion
In this study, we showed that (i) the evolutionary rate was
homogeneous within Antirrhineae; (ii) range overlap between sister
taxa decreases over time, suggesting a signiﬁcant impact of sympatric
speciation on the evolutionary history of the tribe; (iii) the Old World
and the New World had similar diversiﬁcation rates, (iv) betweenregion diversiﬁcation was the main factor aﬀecting diversiﬁcation

positive results in the study. Applying diﬀerent sampling settings to the
analysis with varying assumptions was also crucial to minimize the
eﬀect of sample selection bias. Along these lines, a lack of a correlation
in any of the studied settings makes the argument that pollination does
not have an appreciable eﬀect on diversiﬁcation in this tribe.

rates, and (v) pollination mode had no eﬀect on diversiﬁcation rate in
Antirrhineae.
Our results do not support our hypothesis that transition from bee to
hummingbird pollination is a driving force in Antirrhineae diversiﬁcation. State-dependent diversiﬁcation analyses reveal correlation, but
not causation; therefore the presence of a signiﬁcant relationship
between pollination mode and diversiﬁcation rates would not necessarily provide proof that clades with one pollination mode has higher
diversiﬁcation rates than the other. It should also be noted that these
analyses suﬀer from high rates of type I errors by associating neutral
traits with shifts in diversiﬁcation rates, whereas diﬀerent diversiﬁcation rates could also arise due to other traits not included in the analysis
(Rabosky and Goldberg, 2015). Checking for diversiﬁcation rate
heterogeneity within the tribe prior to examining the eﬀect of any
character states on diversiﬁcation rates was important to avoid false
