Abstract.—The Cape region of South Africa is one of the most remarkable hotspots of biodiversity with a flora comprising
more than 9000 plant species, almost 70% of which are endemic, within an area of only ± 90,000 km2 . Much of the diversity
is due to an exceptionally large contribution of just a few clades that radiated substantially within this region, but little is
known about the causes of these radiations. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of plant diversification, using near
complete species-level phylogenies of four major Cape clades (more than 470 species): the genus Protea, a tribe of legumes
(Podalyrieae) and two speciose genera within the iris family (Babiana and Moraea), representing three of the seven largest
plant families in this biodiversity hotspot. Combining these molecular phylogenetic data with ecological and biogeographical information, we tested key hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the radiation of the Cape flora. Our results
show that the radiations started throughout the Oligocene and Miocene and that net diversification rates have remained
constant through time at globally moderate rates. Furthermore, using sister-species comparisons to assess the impact of different factors on speciation, we identified soil type shifts as the most important cause of speciation in Babiana, Moraea, and
Protea, whereas shifts in fire-survival strategy is the most important factor for Podalyrieae. Contrary to previous findings in
other groups, such as orchids, pollination syndromes show a high degree of phylogenetic conservatism, including groups
with a large number of specialized pollination syndromes like Moraea. We conclude that the combination of complex environmental conditions together with relative climatic stability promoted high speciation and/or low extinction rates as the
most likely scenario leading to present-day patterns of hyperdiversity in the Cape. [Biodiversity hotspots; Cape Floristic
Region; diversification; flowering plants; phylogenetics; speciation.]

The flora of the southwestern tip of Africa is characterized by unique levels of species richness and endemism, reflected in the region’s inclusion of 2 of the
34 hotspots of biodiversity (Mittermeier et al. 2004): the
Cape Floristic Region (CFR) and the Succulent Karoo.
Containing more than 9000 plant species, almost 70% of
which are endemic within an area of only ± 90,000 km2
(Goldblatt and Manning 2000; Goldblatt et al. 2005),
the CFR represents one of the most diverse temperate
floras of the world and is substantially richer than other
Mediterranean-type climate regions (Cowling et al.
1996). Extending along the South African west coast into
southern Namibia, the Succulent Karoo also harbors exceptional numbers of plant species (Driver et al. 2003;
Mittermeier et al. 2004), including 30% of the world’s
10,000 succulents. Close floristic affinities between both
regions led to proposals to unify them as the Greater
Cape Floristic Region (GCFR; Jürgens 1997; Born et al.
2007). Given its remarkable diversity and circumscribed
area, this region provides an excellent model system for
studying the causes of plant diversification.
Much of the diversity in the region is due to the exceptionally large representation of a few diverse clades
that originated and radiated within the Cape (Linder
2003), with some estimates of speciation rates in the

Cape being higher than for tropical rainforests (Latimer
et al. 2005; but see Etienne et al. 2006). Indeed, recent
and rapid radiations have been demonstrated for some
plant groups in southern Africa (Phylica, Richardson
et al. 2001; Ruschioideae, Klak et al. 2003) and it has
been suggested that the whole flora might reflect such
a recent burst of speciation (Levyns 1964; Linder et al.
1992; Sauquet et al. 2009). This “orgy of speciation”
(Linder 2003) has been supposed to have been triggered
by the climatic changes near the Miocene/Pliocene
boundary, with the establishment of the Benguela current leading to a substantially cooler and more arid
climate (Goldblatt and Manning 2000). However, recent
analyses—particularly with the sharp increase in the
availability of dated molecular phylogenies—indicate
that this might not be a general feature of the Cape
flora, but that the radiation of several plant lineages had
started well before these climatic changes took place
(Linder and Hardy 2004; Linder 2005; Verboom et al.
2009). Furthermore, global analyses of vascular plant
species richness (Kreft and Jetz 2007) and of the plant
family Iridaceae (Davies et al. 2005) have shown that
plant diversity in the Cape is significantly higher than
expected given its contemporary environmental conditions. This suggests that, despite the strong influence of

analyses, however, include phylogenies with a high proportion of missing taxa, which introduces uncertainty
regarding the correct assignment of sister species. Furthermore, the study did not control for the number of
realized states in each trait, which eventually precludes
a direct comparison of shift frequencies. The present
study on the other hand is not only based on a more
thorough taxonomic sampling but also accounts for
phylogenetic uncertainty and includes statistical approaches to incorporate the expected null distributions
of the hypotheses. The potential drivers of diversification tested here are of course not restricted to the
Cape. Other Mediterranean-type climate regions share
features such as high topographic complexity or comparable fire regimes (Cowling et al. 1996; Barraclough
2006), and some factors have been suggested to play
an important role in plant diversification in temperate to tropical regions, such as pollinator specialization
(Whittall and Hodges 2007; Tripp and Manos 2008) or
the adaptation to different soil types (Fine et al. 2005).
We are however unaware of any rigorous test of different drivers of diversification for other regions.
Here, we present results of one of the most comprehensive analyses of plant diversification in the Cape,
using data for more than 470 species from four major
Cape clades for which we were able to generate near
complete, multigene species-level phylogenetic trees:
the genus Protea (Proteaceae), the tribe Podalyrieae
(Fabaceae), and the genera Babiana and Moraea (Iridaceae), representing three of the seven largest plant
families in the CFR (Goldblatt et al. 2005). Combining
phylogenetic, ecological, and biogeographical information, we evaluate the competing hypotheses of plant
diversification. Specifically, we use two approaches to
test biotic and abiotic correlates of plant diversification
in the Cape. First, using a whole-tree approach, character states are optimized on the phylogenetic trees,
and links between diversification rate shifts and shifts
in biological and ecological traits are evaluated. Shifts
in diversification rates are expected to coincide with
shifts in traits related to proposed drivers of diversification (e.g., fire-survival strategy). Second, differences
in traits between sister species are compared, based on
the assumption that sister species can be expected to
differ in traits that diverge during speciation (Kurzweil
et al. 1991; Linder 2003; Barraclough 2006). In this case,
avoiding the potential bias of underestimating the number of shifts in labile characters on interior nodes of the
phylogenetic tree, we test whether sister species differ
more often than expected under a null model according
to which traits are distributed randomly.
M ATERIAL AND M ETHODS
Taxon Sampling
The genus Babiana (Iridaceae: Crocoideae) consists of
92 species (Lewis 1959; Goldblatt and Manning 2007b,
2010; Goldblatt et al. 2008), which have radiated extensively in southern Africa, with the vast majority (97%)

climatic conditions on plant diversification, it is unlikely
that climate alone is responsible for the high levels of
plant diversity in the GCFR (Goldblatt and Manning
2000). Indeed, the major forces that drive plant diversification in southern Africa have remained unclear.
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
Cape’s exceptional diversity based on various biotic and
abiotic factors that potentially create reproductive barriers and/or divergent selection pressures and thus promote speciation (Linder 2003; Barraclough 2006). Here,
we consider five commonly discussed factors: First, the
Cape is topographically complex and, therefore, geographical isolation by physical barriers, or divergent
selection caused by sharp altitudinal gradients might
cause speciation (Cowling et al. 2009). This hypothesis
predicts that sister species should tend to be isolated
geographically. In addition, lineages inhabiting more
topographically complex regions should tend to diversify into more species than those in less complex regions
given the availability of larger areas and more complex
habitats. Furthermore, it has been suggested that mountain regions have experienced relatively stable climatic
conditions and promoted the long-term persistence of
lineages (Cowling and Lombard 2002; Linder 2008).
This hypothesis predicts that mountain regions should
harbor a mixture of old and recently derived lineages,
whereas lowland regions should contain more derived
lineages Linder (2008). The second factor, edaphic heterogeneity, might be important by providing a mosaic
of divergent selection pressures promoting divergence
and speciation (Rourke 1972; Linder 2003). This hypothesis predicts that recently diverged sister species should
tend to occur in different edaphic environments. Third
and fourth, pollinator specialization and phenological
shifts might promote speciation by causing reproductive isolation among populations (Johnson 1996; Linder
2003). If these are frequent causes of speciation, we predict that recently diverged sister species should tend to
have different pollinators or flowering times. Finally,
in fire-prone environments, such as the Cape, two different fire-survival strategies have evolved—species
either sprout from underground roots and stems (resprouters) or regenerate only from seeds (reseeders;
Schutte et al. 1995). These strategies are coupled with
different life histories, which could result in a reduction
of gene flow between populations and the avoidance
of competition for resources (Linder 2003). According
to this hypothesis, sister species should frequently have
contrasting fire survival strategies. A second hypothesis
concerning fire survival is the suggestion that reseeding lineages have diversified more than species that
resprout. The mechanism is unclear, but could involve
shorter generation times resulting in higher rates of
molecular evolution in reseeders compared with resprouters (Cowling 1987; but see Verdú et al. 2007). This
hypothesis predicts that clades of reseeders should tend
to have more species than clades of resprouters. In a
recent analysis, van der Niet and Johnson (2009) found
that sister species in the Cape frequently differ in general habitat, pollinators, and fire-survival strategy. Their

2007a, 2007b, 2009, 2010; Rebelo 2001; additional data on
soil types and pollinators were contributed by P. Goldblatt, J.S. Boatwright and T. Rebelo). Lithology and soil
type data were combined in an index for the edaphic
conditions. All ecological and biogeographical data
are available in the Online Supplementary Material at
http://www.sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/.
Polymerase Chain Reaction Amplification, Sequencing,
and Alignment
New sequence data are reported here for Babiana and
Moraea. Total genomic DNA was extracted from 0.2 to
1.0 g of silica-dried leaf material using the 2X CTAB
method (Doyle and Doyle 1987) and purified by caesium chloride/ethidium bromide density gradient (1.55
g/mL; Csiba and Powell 2006). Purified total DNA was
dialyzed in 1 × Tris-EDTA buffer and stored at −80◦ C.
For Moraea, three plastid regions were amplified (the
trnL-trnF region, i.e. the trnL intron and trnL-trnF intergenic spacer; hereafter trnL-F, the rps16 intron and
the rbcL gene), whereas for Babiana, DNA sequences
were produced for nine plastid markers (five coding
regions: matK, trnL, rbcL, rpoC1, and ndhF; three introns:
rps16, rpl16, and trnL as well as three intergenic spacers:
trnL-trnF (combined with the trnL intron and the trnL
30 exon), rpl32-trnL and 3’trnV-ndhC) and one low-copy
nuclear gene (RPB2).
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications in
Moraea were carried out in 50 μL PCR reactions, composed of the ReddyMix PCR Master Mix with 2.5 mM
MgCl2 for trnL-F, rps16, and rbcL (ABgene, Epsom, Surrey, UK), with the addition of 1 μL of bovine serum
albumin (BSA; 0.4%), 50 ng of each primer and 20–50
ng DNA template; the total volume was made up to
50 μl with the addition of sterile distilled water. All
markers for Babiana were amplified in 20 μL reactions,
containing 4 μL of reaction buffer (160 mM (NH4 )2 SO4 ;
670 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.3); 0.1% Tween-20), 2 μl of 25
mM MgCl2 , 0.005% BSA, 0.2 M D-(+)-trehalose (Sigma
T-5251; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), 0.4 μl of 10 mM
dNTPs (Bioline Ltd, London, UK), 0.4 μl of 5 u/μl GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), 0.5–1.0
μl of each 100 mM primer and 1–2 μl of genomic DNA.
Amplifications were performed using a Perkin-Elmer
GeneAmp 9700 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) with 2 min initial denaturation at 94 ◦ C
followed by 30–38 cycles with 1-min denaturation at
94◦ C, 1-min annealing at 48–52◦ C (depending on the
primers used), 1.5-min elongation at 72◦ C and a final 3to 5-min elongation at 72◦ C.
Primer pairs used were X-f (TAATTTACGATCAATT
CATTC) and 5-r (GTTCTAGCACAAGAAAGTCG) for
matK, 1-f and 4-r for rpoC1 (www.kew.org/barcoding),
972-f and 2110-r for ndhF (Olmstead and Sweere 1994),
1-f and 2-r for rps16 (Oxelman et al. 1997), 71-f and
1661-r for rpl16 (Jordan et al. 1996), “c” and “f” for
trnL-F (Taberlet et al. 1991; Shaw et al. 2007), rpL32-f
and trnL(UAG) -r for rpl32-trnL (Shaw et al. 2007) and

being endemic to the GCFR. All species are small to
medium-sized geophytes and display a considerable
amount of floral variation. Pollination studies have
recently led to the description of six largely nonoverlapping pollination systems (Goldblatt and Manning
2007a). Here, we present a near complete species-level
phylogeny representing 87 species based on one nuclear and several plastid markers. Comprising some 200
species of herbaceous geophytes, the genus Moraea (Iridaceae: Iridoideae) is widely distributed in Sub-Saharan
Africa, the Mediterranean Basin, and the Middle East
(Goldblatt et al. 2008) but has the majority of its species
(>75%) in the Cape of South Africa. Similar to Babiana,
floral diversity in Moraea is remarkable with five distinct
pollination systems (Goldblatt et al. 2005). The data set
from a previous phylogenetic analysis of 73 species by
Goldblatt et al. (2002) was substantially extended to 162
species of the genus, including 90% of species that occur in the CFR. The tribe Podalyrieae consists of eight
genera of papilionoid legumes (Schutte and van Wyk
1998) which—except for six species—are endemic to the
CFR, with growth forms ranging from shrublets to tall
upright trees. Species display two different life histories
in response to fire, with slightly less than half of the
species regenerating only from seeds. With very few
exceptions, species in this tribe are adapted to pollination by carpenter bees (Schutte and van Wyk 1998).
Here, we use data from a phylogenetic study for 107
of a total of about 128 species in the tribe (Boatwright
et al. 2008). Finally, the genus Protea is the largest and
most widely distributed genus of Proteaceae in Africa,
comprising about 115 species (Goldblatt and Manning
2000), with about 60% of these being endemic to the
CFR. All species are woody shrubs or trees and, like in
Podalyrieae, two different adaptations to fire regimes
(resprouters and reseeders) can be found. Again, this
genus shows a variety of pollination syndromes, including bird, arthropod, and rodent pollination (Collins
and Rebelo 1987). We use a species-level molecular phylogeny of 90 taxa (Reeves 2001; Valente et al. 2010a)
including all 70 Cape species.
All species distributions were recorded as presence/
absence data in grid cells with an edge length of a
quarter degree (quarter degree square [QDS]). Data for
Babiana were based on collection localities of herbarium
accessions from various herbaria (PRE, NBG, SAM,
BOL, WIND, K). For Podalyrieae, data were taken
from Schutte (1995) and Beaumont et al. (1999) and
cross-referenced with the PRECIS (National Herbarium
Pretoria Computerised Information System) database.
Distribution data for Moraea follow Goldblatt (1986,
1992, 1998) and Goldblatt and Manning (2000, 2002,
2004). For Protea, fine-scale distribution data (1 km 2 )
from the Protea-Atlas Project were rescaled to QDS to
match the resolution of the other groups, and where
unavailable were taken from PRECIS. Information on
fire-survival strategy, lithology, soil type, pollinators,
flowering time and altitudinal ranges for each group
were taken from the literature (Goldblatt 1986, 1992,
1998; Schutte 1995; Beaumont et al. 1999; Goldblatt

Phylogenetic Inference and Divergence Time Estimation
Phylogenetic trees and divergence times for all four
groups were reconstructed using a Bayesian Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach as implemented
in BEAST (v.1.4.7; Drummond and Rambaut 2007),
which allows topology, substitution rates, and node
ages to be estimated simultaneously (Drummond and
Rambaut 2007). The data sets were divided into partitions according to the gene regions used, and the bestfit models of sequence evolution were implemented
according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
scores for substitution models evaluated using MrModeltest (v.2.3; Nylander 2004). A speciation model following a Yule process was selected as the tree prior, with
an uncorrelated lognormal (UCLN) model for the rate
variation among branches. The following secondary
calibration points were used for the analysis, constraining nodes to a normal distribution: For Podalyrieae,
the split between Podalyrieae s.s. and Cadia was set
to a mean 33.58 Ma (central 95% range 29.6–37.5 Ma;
Boatwright et al. 2008); for Protea, the split between Protea and Faurea was constrained with a mean of 28.4 Ma
(central 95% range 24.4–32.3 Ma; Sauquet et al. 2009).
As no fossils have been found to date for Moraea and
Babiana, the calibration points for the phylogenetic trees
were inferred from a recalibration of the Iridaceae family tree (Goldblatt et al. 2008) using the mean root node
age together with the bootstrap estimate of the standard

error (mean: 76 Ma, central 95% confidence interval:
66.2–85.8 Ma) from the study of Wikström et al. (2001).
This provided ages of 18.64 Ma (central 95% range
12.61–25.31 Ma) for the root node of Moraea (the split
between Moraea and Ferraria) and 16.501 Ma (central
95% range 12.15–21.17 Ma) for the split between Babiana
and Chasmanthe. Between 10 and 25 independent runs
of 3,000,000 to 10,000,000 generations, sampling every
2000–5000 generations were performed for each of the
four data sets. Convergence of the runs to the same
posterior distribution and the adequacy of sampling
(using the Effective Sample Size [ESS] diagnostic) were
assessed with Tracer (v.1.4; Rambaut and Drummond
2007). After removing the first 10–25% of the samples
as burn-in, all runs were combined to build the maximum clade credibility tree using TreeAnnotator (v.1.4.7;
Drummond and Rambaut 2007). Matrices and trees in
nexus format are available from TreeBase (accession
number S11132).

Topographic Complexity and Ancestral Range
Reconstruction
To assess the importance of topographic complexity for plant diversification, we tested whether clades
diversified predominantly in topographically complex
regions. Topographic complexity was calculated as the
standard deviation of all grid altitude values at 1 × 1 km
within a QDS grid following Thuiller et al. (2006) using a
digital elevation model obtained from Worldclim (v 1.4;
Hijmans et al. 2005). To test if topographically complex
areas are more species rich, phylogenetically independent contrasts as implemented in MacroCAIC (Agapow
and Isaac 2002) were calculated using the relative rate
difference measure to evaluate the correlation between
per QDS species richness and topographic complexity.
Ancestral habitats were reconstructed in an MCMC
framework, using the MultiState option as implemented
in BayesTraits (Pagel et al. 2004) with the WWF Terrestrial Ecoregions (Olson et al. 2001) as discrete biogeographic units to identify the ecoregion that most likely
constitutes the origin of each clade. BayesTraits employs a continuous-time Markov model that allows
traits to change at any given time to derive the posterior
probability distribution of the likelihood parameters
of the model. Each chain was run for 2,000,000 generations, sampling parameters every 1000 generations
while discarding the first 150,000 generations as burnin. Transition rates between states (i.e., shifts between
biogeographic regions) were set equal using a uniform
prior, and an estimate of the probability of each state at
the root node was derived by combining the particular
posterior probabilities. Mean topographic complexity
was calculated for all terrestrial ecoregions in SubSaharan Africa occupied by at least one of the species
in our study. Novel approaches (e.g., lagrange; Ree and
Smith 2008) offer promising improvements, such as explicit models of dispersal and local extinction based
on multiple area concepts. The current implementation

trnV(UAC) x2-f and ndhC-r for trnV-ndhC (Shaw et al.
2007). rbcL was amplified using two primer pairs: 1-f
and 724(m)-r as well as 636-f and 1367-r (Olmstead et al.
1992; Muasya et al. 1998). For RPB2, primers INT23f and INT23-r (Norup et al. 2006) were only used for
initial amplifications. New primers IRID-f (GC ACA
TAT GGG GAA AGA AGG) and IRID-r (TTA TCC ACC
TGA GAT GAT TGC) were then designed based on
sequences for several genera of the Iridaceae, which
successfully increased the quantity of the PCR product
and prevented the amplification of paralogous loci.
Prior to sequencing, amplified products were cleaned
using NucleoSpin Extract II isolation kit (MachereyNagel GmbH, Düren, Germany) or QIAquick (Qiagen,
Crawley, West Sussex, UK) and the resulting DNA concentration was measured by photospectrometry. Cycle
sequencing (26 cycles; 10-s denaturation at 96 ◦ C, 5-s annealing at 50◦ C, 4-min extension at 60◦ C) with BigDye
Terminators (v3.1; Applied Biosystems) was performed
in 10 μL volumes. Products were purified with 90%
ethanol using a Biomek NX Span-8 automated workstation (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and resuspended
in water for sequencing on an automated ABI 3730 DNA
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) following manufacturers protocols. Sequences were edited using Sequencer
4.5 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) and aligned
by eye in PAUP* v.4.0b10 (Swofford 2002). Voucher information and GenBank/EMBL accession numbers are

Diversification Rates
Net diversification rates of all four groups were calculated following equation 7 of Magallón and Sanderson
(2001) for crown groups under the assumptions of 1) no
extinction (ε = 0) and 2) a high relative extinction rate
(ε = 0.9) to evaluate the tempo of species diversification.
Furthermore, we used both temporal and topological
approaches to test for shifts in diversification rates using branching times and tree topologies, respectively.
First, a maximum likelihood approach (Rabosky 2006b)
was utilized to test whether diversification rates have
changed over time, contrasting the likelihoods of the
data under models with constant diversification rates
against models where rates have varied through time.
Models included in the analysis were a pure-birth (Yule)
and a birth-death model with constant rates as well as
a two-rate Yule model and two density-dependent (logistic and exponential) models as rate-variable options.
The test statistic for a change in diversification rates is
the difference in the AIC score between best-fit rateconstant and rate-variable models. As Rabosky (2006b)
has shown, such comparisons can be prone to a high
probability of a type I error. Thus, to obtain an estimate
of the null distribution of the test statistic (ΔAIC), we
generated 1000 trees for each study group using PhyloGen (Rambaut 2002). This simulation accommodates
incomplete taxon sampling by first generating phylogenetic trees consisting of the number of species described
for each group following a Yule process, and subsequently sampling these trees to reconstruct phylogenies
containing the same number of taxa as included in our
data sets. The observed ΔAIC value is then compared
with the same statistic for the simulated trees, which
provide the null distribution of the test statistic. Second,

a topological approach was used to assesses whether
at any given node we observe an imbalance similar or
greater than expected under a pure-birth (Yule) model
of cladogenesis (Chan and Moore 2005), thus identifying clades that potentially have undergone differential
diversification. The statistic to locate a potential shift
in diversification rates is based on the probability of a
rate shift along the lone internal branch of a three-taxon
tree by comparing the likelihood ratios of 1) a homogeneous (both groups evolve at the same rate), and 2)
a heterogeneous (both clades evolve at different rates)
model for both the nested and the more inclusive node
of the three-taxon clade (Moore et al. 2004). To avoid
false detection of a rate shift at the inclusive node (the
so-called “trickle-down” effect), the likelihood of a shift
along the internal branch is conditioned with the likelihood of a shift occurring within the ingroup. Rate shifts
were analyzed using the Δ1 statistic as implemented in
SymmeTREE (Chan and Moore 2005). The null distribution of the shift statistic was estimated by a Monte
Carlo simulation, generating 1,000,000 trees of the same
size as the study groups under the equal rates Markov
model. To avoid a potential bias caused by incomplete
sampling, missing taxa were added to our phylogenies
using a PERL script (James Cotton, unpublished data).
For each group, 100 trees were created, adding missing species to the phylogeny at random points along
branches within clades identified according to current
taxonomy, subsequently calculating the Δ1 statistic for
each tree. Only diversification rate shifts at nodes with
a posterior probability of 0.85 or higher were taken into
consideration for further analysis. To identify synchronized shifts in diversification rates and species traits
(fire survival, edaphic conditions, and pollinators), ancestral character states were reconstructed on a random
sample of 400 trees from the post–burn-in distribution
of trees from the BEAST analysis using a maximum likelihood approach (Mk1 model) implemented in Mesquite
(Maddison and Maddison 2008).

Modes of Speciation
To test whether speciation tends to involve geographical isolation, we used the age-range correlation (ARC)
approach proposed by Barraclough and Vogler (2000),
which considers the degree of geographical range overlap between sister clades in relation to node age. The
degree of range overlap was calculated by dividing the
area of overlap between sister clades by the range size
of the clade with the smaller range. Hence, values may
vary between 0, indicating no range overlap (allopatry)
and 1, in which case the range of one clade is encompassed entirely by the range of its sister clade (sympatry). Fitting a regression line to the plot between range
overlap and node ages can reveal the predominant
mode of speciation, whereas the slope of the regression
line contains information on the degree of range movements subsequent to speciation, which might constrain
our ability to correctly identify the predominant mode

of lagrange however optimizes ancestral areas onto a
single phylogenetic tree and thus, should only be used
with a very well–supported phylogenetic hypothesis.
Apart from lagrange, only dispersal-vicariance analysis
(DIVA; Ronquist 1997) reconstructs ancestral ranges using a multiple area concept. However, DIVA does not
incorporate branch length, and, as Clark et al. (2008)
have shown, generally reconstructs broad ancestral areas, which contradicts the narrow distribution found
in many extant lineages in the Cape. Given the large
proportion of species within the GCFR that are endemic
to a single ecoregion (species with wider ranges are predominantly found outside of the GCFR), we consider
the approach implemented in BayesTraits as appropriate to reconstruct ancestral habitats. To account for
phylogenetic uncertainty, we used a sample of 400 randomly selected trees from the post–burn-in distribution
of the BEAST analysis. Furthermore, we reconstructed
the ranges of the ancestral and descendant nodes on
branches where a shift in diversification rates was detected (see next paragraph), to assess whether a shift
into a new habitat might be coupled with an increase in
diversification rates.

of speciation. As the measure is bound between 0 and
1, values were arcsine transformed before fitting the regression line (Sokal and Rohlf 1995). To assess whether
present-day ranges still contain a phylogenetic signal of
the mode of speciation, ranges were randomly shuffled
among tips 1000 times, each time recalculating the intercept. The P value represents the proportion of tests with
an intercept more extreme than the one observed (Perret
et al. 2007). The geographical mode of speciation was
also investigated using the Jordan Index (next section).

binary character (e.g., bird pollinated plants vs. plants
pollinated by other vectors) and tested individually for
its influence on rates of speciation and extinction. Significant differences in speciation and extinction rates in
relation to trait changes were assessed using likelihood
ratio tests between unconstrained (six parameters) and
constrained (five parameters, with either speciation or
extinction rates set equal) models. Geographical range
overlap for all sister-species pairs was calculated as described in the previous section. Finally, we calculated
the degree of temporal overlap in flowering times between sister species by dividing the number of months
of phenological overlap by the flowering time of the
species with the shorter flowering period. The average
phenological overlap indicates whether sister species
shows a pattern of co-flowering (index near or equal to
1) or flower at different times (close or equal to 0). To assess the significance of the observed differences between
sister species, we performed 1000 random associations
of sister-species pairs. The significance of sister-species
differences was determined by calculating whether the
observed values fall outside the 95% confidence interval
of the randomization tests. To be conservative, if data
for one species of a sister-species pair was missing or if
the main state could not be assigned with confidence,
the pair was scored as not differing in the trait under consideration, thus avoiding an artificial inflation of
sister-species differences. In addition, only sister-species
pairs with a posterior probability of 0.7 or higher were
included in the analysis.
R ESULTS
Phylogenetic Analysis and Timing of Divergence
Postrun analysis of the MCMC log files from BEAST
indicated parameter convergence and adequate
sampling (ESS values were all above 200). The topologies of the chronograms (Figs S1–S4) were in accordance with trees obtained using other reconstruction
methods (parsimony, maximum likelihood—data not
shown); taxonomic implications for the study groups
will be discussed in detail elsewhere. Examination of the
standard deviation of the UCLN relaxed clock revealed substantial rate variation along branches (Babiana: σ=0.787, 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval 0.651–1.214; Moraea: σ = 0.861, 95% HPD 0.713–1.056;
Podalyrieae: σ = 0.959, 95% HPD 0.81–1.125; Protea:
σ = 0.669, 95% HPD 0.533–0.809) and the measure of
covariance indicates no autocorrelation of rates, justifying the implementation of a relaxed molecular clock.
Although the uncorrelated relaxed clock implemented
in BEAST does not a priori assume a correlation between ancestral and descendant branches, the absence
of an autocorrelation of rates highlights that using alternative dating methods (such as nonparametric rate
smoothing or penalized likelihood) would not be appropriate in our case. Divergence time estimations revealed
stem node ages of the four groups are spread from
the early Oligocene to the mid-Miocene, ranging from

Sister-Species Comparisons: Jordan Index
Differences in traits between sister species were
analyzed using the Jordan Index (JSIS ) as proposed by
Fitzpatrick and Turelli (2006). Excluding deeper nodes
in the phylogeny in the sister-species comparisons
avoids the uncertainty associated with the reconstruction of ancestral character states and follows the rationale that observed differences between sister species
might reflect the differences that led to speciation in the
first place (Linder 2003). Thus, if two sister species differ
in a given trait (e.g., having different pollinators), this
factor might be assumed to be key for the divergence of
the two lineages. If, on the other hand, sister species do
not differ, the trait in question is unlikely to have played
an important role in speciation. The index was calculated for the following traits: fire-survival strategy (for
Podalyrieae and Protea only, not applicable for Babiana
and Moraea), edaphic conditions, and pollinators with
the index taking the value of either 0 (indicating sister
species do not differ) or 1 (indicating that sister species
differ in a given trait) for each pairwise sister-species
comparison. Averaged over all sister-species pairs, the
index provides a measure of the proportion of species
pairs that differ in the trait in question. Accordingly, a
high frequency of sister-species differences would be
expected for traits that drive speciation. Calculations
of the Jordan Index were based on the predominant
states of each trait (e.g., the soil type that species were
most commonly found on). However, to incorporate the
variability in species traits (in particular with regard
to the edaphic conditions), we recalculated the Jordan
Index, this time coding polymorphic species such as
to minimize the number of sister-species differences.
This provides a more conservative estimate of the variability (i.e., the minimum number of shifts) for each
trait and allowed us to assess the robustness of the observed differences. Phylogenetic clustering on the other
hand would be expected not only for traits with no
impact on divergence but also in cases where traits represent a key innovation. Therefore, we tested the effect
of each trait on diversification rates using the BiSSE
Ln Likelihood test (Maddison et al. 2007) implemented
in Mesquite (Maddison and Maddison 2008). The test
calculates the likelihood and parameter estimates of a
six-parameter model consisting of speciation, extinction, and character shift rates for both states of a binary
trait. For the calculations, each trait was scored as a

Ma−1 (95% HPD 0.15–0.39), respectively. Alternatively,
considering a high relative rate of extinction (ε = 0.9),
diversification rates are significantly lower (Podalyrieae:

whether our data are better explained by high or low
extinction rates, we fitted a pure-birth model (ε = 0)
and a birth-death model (with ε = 0.9) to our data using
Laser (Rabosky 2006a), which consistently revealed a
significantly better fit (using likelihood ratio tests) of
the pure-birth model.
The lineage-through-time plot (Fig. 1) shows the substantial spread of the onset of the diversifications, starting in the early Oligocene. Although visual inspection
suggests that rates of diversification have largely remained constant over time, the graphs show a slight
decrease of diversification rates toward the present.
Using a maximum likelihood approach to test for rate
variation through time (Rabosky 2006a), we found that
all groups show significantly decreased diversification
rates toward the present with shifts occurring between
1.67 Ma (Protea) and 0.382 Ma (Moraea; Table 1; the full
output of the maximum likelihood analysis is provided
in Table S2). Such a decrease could however also be an
artefact caused by incomplete taxon sampling (missing
or cryptic species; Pybus and Harvey 2000). Thus, to
assess whether these decreases in diversification rates
are likely to be attributable to incomplete sampling due

Reconstruction of Ancestral Habitats
Analyses of phylogenetically independent contrasts
showed no significant correlation between species richness and topographic complexity (Babiana: t = 0.786,
df = 57, P = 0.446; Moraea: t = −0.153, df = 111, P =
0.879; Podalyrieae: t = −0.93, df = 70, P = 0.355; Protea: t = −0.225, df = 57, P = 0.823). Reconstruction of
ancestral habitats following an MCMC approach identified the “Montane Fynbos and Renosterveld” ecoregion as the most likely ancestral region for Moraea,
Podalyrieae, and Protea, whereas the ”Succulent Karoo”
ecoregion constitutes the most likely ancestral area of
the genus Babiana (Fig. S5). Median probabilities for
these reconstructions across the MCMC analyses were
0.979 (Moraea), 0.987 (Podalyrieae), 0.998 (Protea), and
0.999 (Babiana). The Montane Fynbos and Renosterveld
is among the ecoregions with the highest topographic
complexity (Table S1), whereas the Succulent Karoo is
characterized by a significantly less diverse topography
(t = 13.469, df = 91, P < 0.001).

SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY

Geographical Patterns of Speciation
The observed intercept of the regression between the
degree of sympatry and node ages for Babiana, Moraea,
and Protea is significantly higher (P < 0.001; Table 2)
than those obtained from the randomizations, indicating that the degree of range overlap in these groups
is not random with respect to the phylogeny. Only
in Podalyrieae is the observed intercept not significantly different from the null distribution, suggesting
that present-day ranges might not carry a phylogenetic
signal.
In Babiana 25% (22 of 88) of all nodes show no range
overlap, whereas 16% (14 nodes) are sympatric, including some of the most recent speciation events (Fig. 3).
These include the split between Babiana vanzijliae and
B. papyracea, the latter being a narrow endemic known
only from two populations on the Bokkeveld Plateau.
Further sister-species pairs with sympatric ranges include B. teretifolia and B. hirsuta, both occurring along
the west coast of South Africa, as well as B. karooica
and B. radiata, which are known only from a narrow
region in the Little Karoo. Finally, the range of B. regia
is embedded within that of its sister species B. odorata,
which is common in Swartland region of southwestern
South Africa. The slope of the regression line is slightly
negative (−0.004), indicating almost no range movements. The low observed intercept together with the
positive slope of the regression (0.047) in Moraea suggests predominantly allopatric speciation with range
movements occurring subsequent to speciation. No
range overlap is shown in 37% (59 of 160) of the nodes,
whereas only 6% (9 nodes) are fully sympatric, among
which are some of the most recent splits (Fig. 3). Sisterspecies pairs with overlapping ranges include Moraea
kamiesensis and M. fenestralis, with the range of the former being restricted to the Kamiesberg Mountains in
the Northern Cape, and entirely enclosed in the range of
M. fenestralis. A second pair comprises M. verecunda and
M. pseudospicata, two local endemics from the Bokkeveld
Plateau around Nieuwoudtville. In Podalyrieae, the low

intercept and positive slope of the regression (0.041)
again suggests predominantly allopatric speciation in
this group. This pattern was, however, not found to be
significant (Table 2). In addition, 50% of all nodes (54
of 108) are allopatric, whereas only 6% (7 nodes) show
complete range overlap, none of which represent recent speciation events (Fig. 3). In Protea, the observed
intercept, despite being significantly higher than expected at random, together with the positive slope of
the regression (0.039), suggests once more that speciation is predominantly allopatric. However, although
16% (14 of 84) of the nodes have no range overlap,
19% (16 nodes) are fully sympatric, including several
recent splits (Fig. 3). In most cases, these sisters-species
pairs consist of one range-restricted species (Protea pudens, P. stokoei, and P. scabriusucula) whose range is
encompassed entirely by their sister species (P. longifolia, P. speciosa, and P. scolopendriifolia respectively). In
another case, both P. susannae and P. obtusifolia are common on the coastal flats of the southwestern Cape, on
neutral sand and limestone, respectively.
Sister-Species Analyses
Geographical range overlap between sister species
was found to be relatively low (Babiana: 0.275, Moraea:
0.173, Podalyrieae: 0.205, Protea: 0.409), consistent with
the predominantly allopatric mode of speciation found
in the ARC analysis. The proportion of sister species
differing in traits was found to vary substantially between groups as well as for different traits. All ecological traits were found to be phylogenetically clustered in
a least some of the groups studied (Table 3 and Fig. 2).
Within Podalyrieae, about half of the sister-species pairs
show differences in their fire-survival strategy (JSIS 0.55;
Table 3); whereas in Protea different fire-survival strategies were found in less than 20% of sister-species pairs
(Table 3). Differences in edaphic conditions were very
high, especially in Babiana, Moraea, and Podalyrieae,
where between 71% and 92% of sister-species pairs
occur in different edaphic environments (Table 3 and
Fig. 2). Differences in Protea on the other hand are much
lower (JSIS 0.334), showing significantly less variation
between sister species than expected at random. To
further scrutinize the effect of edaphic conditions, we
also calculated the Jordan Index separately for lithology and soil types (Table S3), which despite yielding a
pattern similar to the combined factor, did not show a
significant clustering. With the exception of Babiana (JSIS
0.471; Table 3), pollinator shifts between sister species
occur significantly less frequently than based on our
randomizations, revealing again a pattern of phylogenetic clustering, with a low frequency of shifts between
sister species (Moraea 0.25, P < 0.001; Podalyrieae 0,
P < 0.001; Protea 0.231, P < 0.001; Table 3). The BiSSE Ln
Likelihood test yielded no significant differences in speciation or extinction rates for any of the traits analyzed
(Table S4).
As direct comparisons of the proportion of sisterspecies differences (JSIS ) between lineages and between

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/60/3/343/1666085 by guest on 02 March 2020

to cryptic speciation, we excluded the lowest 5th percentile of node ages (Babiana: 0.75 Ma; Moraea: 0.54 Ma;
Podalyrieae: 1.45 Ma, Protea: 1.08 Ma). This enabled
us to potentially detect further rate shifts in periods
deeper in the phylogenies, unaffected by sampling biases. Comparisons show that for the constrained data
set, rate-variable models do not provide a significantly
better fit than rate-constant models (Babiana: ΔAIC =
3.301, p = 0.09; Moraea: ΔAIC = −1.061, P = 0.83; Protea:
ΔAIC = 2.815, P = 0.24).
The topological approach to identify potential shifts
in diversification rates identified six significant rate
shifts, two each in Babiana and Moraea and one in Podalyrieae and Protea, respectively (Fig. 2). Comparisons
with the reconstructed trait states revealed the absence
of direct links between diversification rate shifts and
shifts in the habitat or traits included in our analysis
(Fig. 2, data for fire survival not shown).

traits is restricted by the variable number of states, the
shift frequency (JSIS ) was conditioned by the number
of realized states, thus obtaining a measure of the relative variability of each trait. The results show that for
Babiana, Moraea, and Protea, soil types exhibit the highest variability between sister species (Table 4), whereas
changes in fire-survival strategy show the highest degree of variability in Podalyrieae (Table 4). Calculating
the Jordan Index under a conservative scenario of sisterspecies differences (minimum number of shifts for polymorphic characters) resulted in slightly lower estimates
of sister-species differences, but had little impact on
the overall patterns. Most importantly, soil types still
displayed the highest variability in Babiana (0.111),
Moraea (0.12), and Protea (0.097). Thus, even assuming the most conservative pattern of trait shifts between
sister species, soil types remain the most variable factor. The analysis of flowering times showed that sister
species exhibit a high degree of phenological overlap
(Babiana 0.569, P = 0.42; Moraea 0.762, P < 0.001; Poda-

lyrieae 0.628, P = 0.08; Protea 0.744, P < 0.001), which
in the case of Moraea and Protea is significantly higher
than expected based on the randomization of flowering
times.

D ISCUSSION
Diversification of the Cape Flora: Timing and Dynamics
The start of the diversification of some of the key elements of the Cape flora analyzed here is spread from the
early Oligocene to the mid-Miocene. This range agrees
well with dates identified for several other lineages in
southern Africa (Linder 2005; Verboom et al. 2009), indicating that the radiation of the Cape flora was not a
singular event, and corroborating findings that it represents a mixture of older and more recent radiations
(Linder 2005, 2008; Verboom et al. 2009). Although the
clades analyzed here diversified at higher rates than
the average of their respective families and orders (see

Notes: Proportion of observed pairwise species differences conditioned by the number of states in each category. Traits with the highest

It is important to note though that although the maximum likelihood method to detect temporal shifts in diversification rates assumes constant rates across clades
(Rabosky 2006b), and therefore is suitable to identify
shifts that affect the entire lineage (e.g., large-scale environmental changes that act throughout the geographic
range of a lineage), a node-by-node examination of tree
imbalances can identify diversification rate shifts that
occur in only one or a few clades (“concealed” shifts).
The whole-tree test for diversification rate shifts identified eight potential shifts, none of which were directly
linked to shifts in species traits, suggesting that trait
shifts and diversification rate shifts seem to be largely
decoupled, indicating that other factors not included in
this study might be driving these rate shifts. The test,
however, cannot distinguish between increases and decreases in diversification rates, as decreases (which can
be caused by either a significant increase in extinction
or decrease in speciation rates) will eventually lead to
the loss of the corresponding phylogenetic information throughout the evolutionary history of the lineage
(Moore et al. 2004), and thus, rate shifts are interpreted
as increases along the branch leading to the more diverse clade. Nevertheless, we remain cautious about the
interpretation of the diversification rate shifts, especially
in cases where species-poor lineages are nested within
more diverse clades.
Spatial Patterns of Speciation
Our analysis of the geographical mode of speciation
showed that all groups apart from Podalyrieae have
intercepts significantly different from those obtained
under the range randomization test. Thus, present-day
distributions might still contain information on the
mode of speciation. Using the correlation between node
ages and degree of sympatry, we infer that the geographic mode of speciation is predominantly allopatric,
although extensive range movements have occurred as
apparent by the wide scatter of overlap values. However, in a few cases, we found recently diverged sister
species occurring in sympatry, a pattern that might
reflect sympatric speciation occurring at least at low
frequencies. Alternatively, the high degree of range
overlap observed might be due to the spatial resolution
of the distribution data used in this study. The QDS
grid cells have an area of approximately 625 km2 and
thus omit variations at finer scales. The availability of

Magallón and Castillo 2009), diversification rates are in
general intermediate, and not among the highest rates
reported for other major radiations in southern Africa
(Richardson et al. 2001, 0.56–0.65 spp. per Ma; Klak et al.
2003, 0.76–1.75 spp. per Ma), in other Mediterraneantype climate regions (Valente et al. 2010b, 2.21–7.55 spp.
per Ma), on oceanic islands (Baldwin and Sanderson
1998, 0.43–0.57 spp. per Ma), or in the tropics (Hughes
and Eastwood 2006, 2.1–3.1 spp. per Ma). Thus, diversification rates of the Cape clades cannot be considered
extraordinary on a global scale, suggesting that the diversity of the Cape flora might in large parts not be
the result of a recent and rapid burst in speciation; a
radiation triggered by the climatic deterioration at the
end of the Miocene seems therefore unlikely. Here, we
additionally demonstrate that net rates of diversification remained constant through time, lacking marked
changes during periods of changing environmental conditions. These results contradict those of Crisp and Cook
(2009), who analyzed the diversification of Podalyrieae
and concluded that a significant increase in diversification rates reveals the signature of a mass extinction
event at the end of the Eocene. However, their study
includes only a subset of the markers used in this study
and their root node age of about 50 Ma for the tribe is
somewhat puzzling given that Boatwright et al. (2008)
provide a much younger age for the root of this clade
(33.58 Ma). All groups show a significant decrease in net
diversification rates between 1.67 and 0.382 myr before
present, which could reflect limitations for speciation
in an increasingly diverse flora. Although an actual decrease in diversification rates cannot be ruled out, the
observed slowdown might also be attributed to a sampling artefact, as the exclusion of only the lowest 5th
percentile of nodes resulted in the absence of significant
diversification rate shifts.

SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY

Drivers of Plant Diversification
Ancestral range reconstructions identified the Montane Fynbos and Renosterveld ecoregion as the most
likely ancestral habitat for the three of the clades studied here, with only Babiana having its ancestral range in
the Succulent Karoo. These findings suggest that high
topographical complexity of the Cape Mountains could
be promoting species diversity by 1) providing opportunities for habitat differentiation, 2) restricting gene
flow between geographically isolated populations, or 3)
increasing the persistence of species. A test for habitat
differentiation reveals only a weak negative correlation
between geographical and altitudinal range overlap
(b = −0.15, r = −0.09; n = 17, sister species with geographical range overlap >0.5). The predominantly allopatric mode of speciation (Table 2) on the other hand,
together with evidence that dispersal distances in the
Cape are generally short (Goldblatt and Manning 2000;
Latimer et al. 2005), suggests that the second scenario
provides a more plausible explanation. Finally, our results show that species diversity is not significantly
different between areas of high and low topographic
complexity, suggesting that lineages have probably also
diversified extensively in habitats with reduced topographic complexity. As the potential for clades to diversify also depends on the area of the geographical region
(Losos and Schluter 2000; Davies et al. 2005), area itself
might be considered important independently of habitat
complexity. Valente et al. (2010a) have shown however
that diversification rates in the genus Protea were similar
within and outside of the CFR (extending into tropical
Africa), despite the vastly different available areas, suggesting that area per se does not explain the observed
differences in diversity. Indeed, the topographically
complex Montane Fynbos and Renosterveld actually
provides a smaller total surface area than the less complex Succulent Karoo (approximately 3.4 times larger)
or Lowland Fynbos and Renosterveld ecoregions (approximately 1.3 times larger). Together with the finding
that ancestral habitats are predominantly topographically complex areas, this provides evidence for a higher
persistence of lineages these regions, suggesting that,
in part, low levels of extinction in mountainous regions
have contributed to present-day patterns of diversity.
Although sister-species analyses avoid uncertainties
associated with the reconstruction of character changes

on the phylogeny, this approach relies on a number of
assumptions. First, the identification of traits driving
speciation is based on the concept of competition for
limiting factors; and second, species ranges and ecologies are assumed to reflect conditions immediately following speciation, rather than resulting from changes
occurring since speciation. Despite a high probability
that some ecological changes and range movements
have occurred after sister species have become separated, the large sample size and wide taxonomic range
allows us to identify patterns of plausible drivers of
speciation even in the presence of these potentially confounding effects. The factor with the highest variability
between sister species in three of four groups (Babiana,
Moraea, and Protea) is soil type, consistent with the idea
that adaptation to different soil types could be a major
driver of plant diversification in southern Africa. This
is supported by the high diversity of soil types found
in the southwestern Cape (Fig. S6), which has gradually
increased during the late Cenozoic (Cowling et al. 2009).
Furthermore, these results are consistent with studies
of Neotropical plant species (Fine et al. 2004, 2005),
which highlighted the potential importance of edaphic
heterogeneity in plant speciation. In Podalyrieae, firesurvival strategy is more variable than other traits and
thus should be considered a potential driver of diversification in this group. This is highlighted by the fact that
fire-survival strategy is often the most important distinguishing character between closely related—and morphologically almost identical—species (Schutte et al.
1995). These findings are robust with regard to sampling
effort, which could potentially affect the correct identification of sister species. Considering only clades where
taxon sampling is above 90% (the genera Liparia, Podalyria, Stirtonanthus, Virgilia, and Xiphotheca), we find the
same level of variation and thus conclude that the observed differences are unlikely to be a sampling artefact.
Shifts in fire-survival strategy have previously received
little attention and the frequent shifts between sister
species are somewhat surprising, especially as species
with a mixed fire biology are rare (Linder 2003), but the
adaptations involved in a switch between different firesurvival strategies may not be as complex as previously
thought (Verdaguer and Ojeda 2005). Furthermore, maximum likelihood reconstructions of fire-survival strategies in Podalyrieae yielded largely equivocal states for
deeper nodes in the tree, but maximum parsimony reconstructions indicate that the first shift in fire-survival
strategies occurred in the early Miocene. This coincides
with a period when summer droughts in the Cape were
already in place and just before the suggested establishment of regular fires within the region (Bytebier et al.
2011), providing further support for the importance of
fire as a driver of diversification in Podalyrieae. Finally,
the high phenological overlap between sister species
indicates that shifts in flowering times do not act as a
driving force in the creation and/or maintenance of reproductive barriers in these clades, although evidence
in other clades suggest a potential role of phenology in
the reduction of gene flow (Linder 2001).

high-resolution distribution data for Protea (1-km grid)
allowed us to evaluate the extent of range overlap of
putative sympatric species at different spatial scales,
which, as expected, is substantially lower than at the
QDS scale (mean difference in range overlap: 59%),
with no sister-species pair still being fully sympatric
(Table S5). Thus, the relatively coarse scale of this study
clearly inflates the degree of range overlap, and although
fine-scale distribution data are currently not available
for the other groups, we can assume that at least some
but possibly all of the cases identified as being sympatric
might in fact also rather be parapatric or allopatric.

One constraint of the Jordan Index used here for
sister-species comparisons is the limited power to distinguish traits with a causal role in speciation from
those that show a high degree of variability (as in the
null model). However, we feel that in this case using
random associations as a null hypothesis is more appropriate than the one that assumes no difference between
sister species (due to phylogenetic conservatism), in
particular given that Losos (2008) and Wiens (2008)
pointed out that these patterns should be tested rather
than assumed a priori. Thus, the test statistic might
have limitations to detect a positive effect of a trait on
diversification but is powerful (albeit conservative) to
reject hypotheses of potential drivers of plant diversification. This is the case when traits 1) are found to
rarely differ between sister species, and 2) lack the signature of a key innovation. For example, apart from
the genus Babiana, pollination systems show a high degree of phylogenetic conservatism, and the absence of
a significant effect on speciation and/or extinction rates
indicates that shifts in pollination systems are unlikely
to be a main driver of diversification in these clades.
These conclusions contradict the results of van der Niet
and Johnson (2009), who found shifts in pollinators to
be more frequent than shifts in soil types. However, as
their analysis did not control for the number of realized states in each trait, no definitive conclusions can
be drawn regarding the causes of speciation. Potential
explanations for the high frequency of pollinator shifts
observed in Babiana could be that pollinator shifts are
the result of a direct selection for reproductive isolation in secondary contact zones between sister species
adapted to different soil types (Goldblatt and Manning
1996; van der Niet et al. 2006), or that the diversity
of pollination systems might in fact be the result, not
the cause, of high species richness (Armbruster and
Muchhala 2009).
In conclusion, our study shows that the remarkable
plant diversity in the Cape of southern Africa is not the
result of a recent and rapid radiation triggered by climatic changes, but that diversification took place over
an extended period of time. Furthermore, the relative
climatic stability in the Cape throughout the late Cenozoic (Linder 2003; Cowling et al. 2009) may have resulted in lower extinction rates. Together with complex
geomorphologic conditions—in particular the increase
in topo-edaphic complexity and the establishment of
regular fires—we argue that this, rather than pollinator
specialization or phenological divergence has generated the exceptional plant diversity found in the Cape
biodiversity hotspot today. Further insights into the
evolution of the flora could be gained from considering
the combined effects and interactions of several factors.
Such analyses however require a larger sample size,
and could be usefully addressed in future studies including the entire Cape flora. Comparisons with other
hotspots, especially those with a Mediterranean climate
will reveal whether the patterns described here provide a global scenario for the evolution of hyperdiverse
floras.
