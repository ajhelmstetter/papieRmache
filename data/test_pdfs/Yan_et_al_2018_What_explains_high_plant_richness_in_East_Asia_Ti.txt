 What causes the disparity in biodiversity among regions is a fundamental question in biogeography, ecology, and evolutionary biology. Evolutionary and biogeographic processes
(speciation, extinction, dispersal) directly determine species richness patterns, and can be
studied using integrative phylogenetic approaches. However, the strikingly high richness of
East Asia relative to other Northern Hemisphere regions remains poorly understood from this
perspective. Here, for the first time, we test two general hypotheses (older colonization time,
faster diversification rate) to explain this pattern, using the plant tribe Lysimachieae (Primulaceae) as a model system.
 We generated a new time-calibrated phylogeny for Lysimachieae (13 genes, 126 species),
to estimate colonization times and diversification rates for each region and to test the relative
importance of these two factors for explaining regional richness patterns.
 We find that neither time nor diversification rates alone explain richness patterns among
regions in Lysimachieae. Instead, a new index that combines both factors explains global richness patterns in the group and their high East Asian biodiversity.
 Based on our results from Lysimachieae, we suggest that the high richness of plants in East
Asia may be explained by a combination of older colonization times and faster diversification
rates in this region.

Introduction
Why do some regions have higher species diversity than others?
Explaining richness patterns is a major goal of ecology, biogeography, and evolutionary biology. For example, 25 biodiversity
hotspots cover c. 1.4% of Earth’s land surface, but include
c. 44% of vascular plant species and c. 35% of species in four vertebrate groups (Myers et al., 2000). However, the underlying
causes of many diversity patterns remain unclear. For example,
despite many studies on the latitudinal diversity gradient (e.g.
Willig et al., 2003; Mittelbach et al., 2007) and elevational richness gradients (e.g. Hutter et al., 2013), other richness patterns
remain insufficiently studied and poorly understood.
Many factors may ultimately impact species richness, but only
three processes can directly change species numbers in a region:
speciation, extinction, and dispersal (Ricklefs, 1987). Given this
perspective, two major hypotheses can explain why certain
regions have more species than others (review in Wiens, 2011):
(1) more time for richness to accumulate through speciation in
regions that have been colonized longer (e.g. Willis, 1922); and/
or (2) faster rates of net diversification (speciation–extinction) in
436 New Phytologist (2018) 219: 436–448

lineages in high-diversity regions (e.g. Fischer, 1960), presumably
due to ecological conditions there that increase speciation, reduce
extinction, or both. These hypotheses can be tested using phylogenetic approaches for estimating biogeographic history and
diversification rates. We do not treat ‘carrying capacity’ as a separate hypothesis since it can influence both colonization times and
diversification rates (Pontarp & Wiens, 2017), but (like climate)
does not directly change species numbers itself.
A striking but still unexplained richness pattern involves the
remarkable species diversity of plants in East Asia (China, Japan,
and Korea) relative to similar latitudes in North America and
Europe (Latham & Ricklefs, 1993; Qian & Ricklefs, 2000; Qian,
2001, 2002; Adams, 2009). For example, China is among the
world’s most megadiverse countries (> 32 000 vascular plant
species, c. 1.5 times more than the USA and Canada combined;
Hong & Blackmore, 2013). Several explanations have been proposed to explain this diversity anomaly in terms of speciation,
extinction, and colonization times. These hypotheses suggest that
lineages in East Asia have lower extinction rates (i.e. during Quaternary Ice Ages; Adams, 2009), higher speciation rates (Xiang
et al., 2004), higher net diversification rates (Axelrod et al., 1996;

(e.g. Banfi et al., 2005; Manns & Anderberg, 2009). We followed
the traditional classification, but our results also support expansion of Lysimachia. We therefore place these genera in quotation
marks.
In total, 126 Lysimachieae species were sampled in the phylogeny, including c. 50% of the 250 described species (Ray,
1956; Hu & Kelso, 1996; Cholewa et al., 2009; Manns & Anderberg, 2009). Our sampling includes all genera, all infrageneric
taxa, and all major biogeographic regions. Five outgroup taxa
(from Myrsinaceae) were also included (Myrsine semiserrata,
Myrsine faberi, Myrsine seguinii, Ardisia verbascifolia, and Embelia
ribes). These taxa are all closely related to Lysimachieae (e.g.
K€allersj€o et al., 2000; Yesson et al., 2009).
Details on taxon sampling and species distributions are provided in Table S2. Species sampled per region are given in
Table 1. There was a very strong relationship between the total
richness of each region and the richness sampled in the tree from
each region (r2 = 0.99; P < 0.0001). Among regions, the proportion of species sampled ranged from 0.42 to 1.00 (mean: 0.73).
Details on estimating regional richness (and delimiting regions)
are provided later. There was also a very strong relationship
between each clade’s overall richness and its richness in our tree
(r2 = 0.94; P < 0.0001; Table S3).

Qian & Ricklefs, 2000), or were present in East Asia longer than
in other regions (Latham & Ricklefs, 1993). However, few studies have used a phylogenetic approach to directly test these
hypotheses. Xiang et al. (2004) inferred higher speciation rates in
East Asia than in eastern North America by comparing species
richness and substitution rates between 10 sister clades with
species in both regions. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no previous studies have directly tested both the diversification-rate and
time hypotheses to explain East Asia’s exceptional species
richness.
Here, we use the tribe Lysimachieae (Primulaceae) to test
whether high richness in East Asia is explained by older colonization times, faster diversification rates, or both. Lysimachieae
offers an excellent model system. They are distributed globally,
but most species occur in East Asia (171 spp.), with fewer species
in other regions (< 30 each; Table 1).
We test the time and diversification-rate hypotheses using phylogenetic approaches. We first combine new molecular data with
previously published data to estimate a time-calibrated phylogeny
for Lysimachieae. We next perform biogeographic analyses to
estimate their time of colonization in each region. We then examine the relationship between colonization time and current richness of regions to test the time hypothesis. Finally, we estimate
diversification rates of Lysimachieae clades in each region and test
for relationships between overall diversification rates of regions
and their current richness. We also develop a new index that
combines the time and diversification-rate hypotheses.

Phylogenetic analysis
A total of 1111 new sequences were generated (84.62% of 13
genes for 126 species). Sequences included 10 plastid loci (i.e.
matK, rbcL, trnL-F, trnH-psbA, rpl20-rps12, atpF-atpH, atpBrbcL, rps16, trnS-trnG, rpl32-trnL) and one nuclear locus (internal transcribed spacer region of nuclear ribosomal DNA; ITS,
including ITS1, 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene, and ITS2). Total
genomic DNA was isolated from silica-gel-dried fresh material or
herbarium materials using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide protocol (Doyle & Doyle, 1987). Primers for amplification and sequencing are described in Table S4. PCR amplification followed Zhang et al. (2012). New sequences were deposited
in GenBank (Table S5).
To increase species sampling, we included sequences from 14
‘Anagallis’ species (Manns & Anderberg, 2005, 2011) and seven

Materials and Methods
Taxonomy
We generally follow the taxonomy established by Pax & Knuth
(1905) and followed in recent studies (e.g. Hu, 1994; St
ahl &
Anderberg, 2004). Thus, Lysimachieae includes six genera:
Lysimachia (211 species), Anagallis (31), Trientalis (3), Glaux (1),
Asterolinon (2), and Pelletiera (2). Species and their regional distributions (based on previous literature) are listed in Supporting
Information Table S1. However, some traditionally recognized
genera have been merged into Lysimachia in recent studies

from Lysimachia subgenus Lysimachiopsis (Oh et al., 2013). We
used data from GenBank for all 11 genes sequenced here (with
available data), and two additional plastid loci (rpl16 ndhF;
Table S5). These new taxa lacked data for some markers. However, the limited missing data in our matrix (mean: 25.58% per
species for 131 species) should have little impact on topology
estimation or divergence dating, based on simulations and empirical analyses (e.g. Wiens & Morrill, 2011; Zheng & Wiens,
2015). Furthermore, the placements of these incomplete taxa in
our tree and in previous studies (Manns & Anderberg, 2005,
2011; Oh et al., 2013) were congruent.
Sequences were initially aligned using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004),
with subsequent manual adjustments using BIOEDIT (Hall,
1999). Aligned sequences were combined into a single matrix.
Most data (12 759 of 13 462 base pairs) were from the chloroplast genome, which behaves as a single linked region (e.g. Son &
Park, 2016). Indels were treated as missing data.
We used PARTITIONFINDER v.1.1.1 (Lanfear et al., 2012) to
select the optimal combination of partitioning schemes and
DNA substitution models for the concatenated matrix, using the
greedy algorithm. The Bayesian information criterion was used
to compare model fit. The best-fitting set of partitions and models was then applied to divergence-time estimation (Tables S6–
S7). The main goal here was to estimate a time-calibrated phylogeny with BEAST. Additional likelihood and Bayesian analyses
(details in Methods S1) gave similar topologies to each other
(Fig. S1) and to those from BEAST.
Divergence-time estimation
We used the Bayesian uncorrelated-lognormal relaxed-clock
approach (Drummond et al., 2006) in BEAST v.2.3.2 (Bouckaert
et al., 2014) on XSEDE (CIPRES Science Gateway; Miller et al.,
2010). We used both Yule speciation and birth–death tree priors
(Drummond & Bouckaert, 2015). Both gave similar results
(Table S8). We ran four independent analyses (50 million generations each, sampled every 5000). Run results were combined
using LOGCOMBINER (Bouckaert et al., 2014), after discarding the
first 25% of generations from each analysis as burn-in. Convergence was assessed using TRACER v.1.6 (Rambaut et al., 2014),
based on effective sample sizes on likelihoods > 200 (Drummond
et al., 2006). The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was
summarized using TREEANNOTATOR (Bouckaert et al., 2014).
Means and 95% highest posterior densities (HPDs) of age estimates were visualized using FIGTREE v.1.4.2 (Rambaut, 2009).
Appropriate calibrations are crucial for divergence dating (Ho
& Phillips, 2009), but few reliable fossils are known for Lysimachieae. Therefore, we used one fossil calibration and two secondary calibration points (from other dating analyses). Fossil
seeds similar to Lysimachia vulgaris are known from the latest part
of the Middle Miocene (12–16 Ma; Friis, 1985). Oh et al. (2008)
found that seeds of L. vulgaris and its close relatives (Lysimachia
terrestris, Lysimachia thyrsiflora) are very similar (all species in
Clade IV in our phylogeny). These species all have a poroid–alveolate seed-coat surface, a sponge-like outer layer, and columnar
cells in the outer seed-coat layer (Oh et al., 2008). We therefore

used this seed fossil to set the age prior for Clade IV. Some
species in the clade presently lack data on seed morphology, but
the clade is strongly supported by molecular results (Hao et al.,
2004; this study), pollen type (Bennell & Hu, 1983), and chromosome number (n = 21; L€ove & L€ove, 1982; Probatova et al.,
2006). We assigned this fossil to the crown group of Clade IV
(including L. vulgaris and relatives) using the standard lognormal
prior distribution with a mean of 1, a deviation of 2, and an offset of 12 Ma. This combination yields a 95% credible interval
(CI) on the lognormal distribution from 12 to 15.6 Ma, congruent with the hypothesized age of the seed fossil (Friis, 1985). The
lognormal distribution assumes the clade’s age will likely be close
to the fossil’s age but could be older (i.e. clades can be older than
their oldest fossil representatives). The lognormal distribution is
considered the most generally appropriate prior for fossil calibrations (Ho & Phillips, 2009).
Two secondary calibration points were also used. First, we
used the crown age of Clades I–VIII (including core Lysimachia
and ‘Anagallis’), with an estimated mean age of 28.47 Ma (95%
HPD = 23.03–37.67 Ma) from Strijk et al. (2014). For the crown
age of this node (Clade I–VIII) we used a normal prior distribution with mean of 28.5 Ma and standard deviation (SD) of 4 Ma
(95% HPD = 21.9–35.1 Ma).
The other secondary calibration point was the stem age of
Lysimachieae. However, previous studies estimated somewhat
different ages for this clade. As explained later, we used three different ages in separate analyses, which gave similar results
(Table S8). We therefore used the intermediate age for all subsequent analyses. First, Yesson et al. (2009) estimated the Lysimachieae stem at c. 30 Ma based on two datasets, but without
confidence intervals. Similarly, Zanne et al. (2014) estimated the
Lysimachieae stem at 28.2 Ma (no confidence interval). However, Strijk et al. (2014) estimated 37.88 Ma (95% HPD =
26.84–50.46 Ma). Renner & Schaefer (2010) estimated 41 Ma
(28–52 Ma). We used three sets of priors for the Lysimachieae
stem in three separate analyses, each with a normal distribution.
First, we used 30 Ma (SD = 6 Ma), yielding a 95% HPD of
20–40, following Yesson et al. (2009) and Zanne et al. (2014).
Second, we used 37.9 Ma (SD = 7 Ma (26.4–49.4 Ma)) following Strijk et al. (2014). Third, we used 41 Ma (SD = 7 Ma (29.5–
52.5 Ma)) following Renner & Schaefer (2010).
In order to test the effect of the secondary calibration points,
we also performed analyses using only the fossil calibration.
However, all analyses yielded similar clade ages overall (see the
Results section; Tables S8–S10), and subsequent analyses used
the intermediate calibration point. Importantly, biogeographic
and diversification analyses were also conducted on these alternative trees. The data matrix and all MCC trees files generated here
are available as supporting information (Notes S1).
Incomplete species sampling might affect dating results
(Stadler, 2009). We used two approaches to address these effects.
First, we used the ‘birth–death skyline contemporary’ prior in
BEAST v.2.3.2 to account for incomplete sampling, following
Stadler et al. (2013). However, the major clades consistently estimated by other analyses were not recovered. Therefore, we did
not consider these results further. Second, we subsampled species

New
Phytologist
from our tree, to see if age estimates were robust to incomplete
sampling (if they are, it would suggest that our original subsampling should not strongly impact age estimates). We randomly
sampled species from each major clade (using R 3.2.3; R Core
Team, 2015) and performed BEAST analyses with the calibrations
and tree priors described earlier. We randomly selected two or
three species per large clade (≥ 10 species sampled) using R. For
smaller clades, we included a single, randomly selected species.
We included 26 species in total, including one outgroup, representing 10% of all Lysimachieae species. We then performed a
regression between the stem ages of the 11 major clades from the
subsampled analyses and the full analyses.
Biogeographic analyses
We compiled distributional data (Table S1) for all species
described using literature data, assigning each species to one or
more geographic regions. We generally used standard geographic
definitions of continental boundaries to delineate regions, but
with some differences based on patterns of endemism in Lysimachieae. Specifically, we used seven regions (Fig. 1): (A) East
Asia, (B) Mediterranean region of Europe, (C) Africa, including
Madagascar but excluding North Africa, (D) North America, (E)
Central–South America, (F) Hawaii, and (G) Australasia.
Detailed limits of regions (and their justifications) are given in
Methods S2. Species could be assigned to more than one region
using the biogeographic method used here (see below).
Colonization events were inferred using the dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis (DEC) model in RASP v.3.2 (Yu et al., 2015)
based on LAGRANGE (Ree & Smith, 2008). Analyses were performed using the MCC tree from BEAST. All ingroup taxa were
included. We used a transition matrix (Q-matrix) to reflect
changes in paleogeographic events (land bridges between continents) or dispersal ability between those areas (e.g. stepping stone
dispersal or long-distance dispersal across oceans) in different
time slices (Table S11). We obtained effectively identical results
without these assumptions (Table S12). We found that 90.48%
(114/126) of ingroup species are restricted to one region, whereas
only 12 species occur in two to five regions (Table S2). Therefore,
we initially ran RASP allowing ancestral species to occur in a maximum of two areas. We also used likelihood ratio, v2, and Akaike
information criterion tests to compare the fit of different assumptions about the maximum number of regions. AIC weights
(AICw) for each main clade (its crown and stem node) were interpreted as the relative probabilities of all possible ancestral states
(Yu et al., 2015). The most likely state for each node (region with
highest proportional likelihood) was used to test the time hypothesis. The analyses were also performed using all alternative trees
from BEAST (except the subsampling analyses).
Time hypothesis
We examined the relationship between regional species richness
and the oldest colonization time for each region using leastsquares linear regression (following Stephens & Wiens, 2003).
We did not correct for phylogeny in these analyses because they

were based on regions (which lack a phylogeny). We integrated
the time-calibrated phylogeny with the ancestral areas estimated
for each node to estimate when Lysimachieae colonized each
region for the first time. However, it is impossible to infer when
exactly on a given branch a region was colonized. Therefore, we
simply assumed that biogeographic changes were on the middle
of the branch (i.e. midpoint of crown and stem ages). Deviations
from this assumption should have little impact, since the relative
times are of interest here and most branches are short. Some
clades had two ancestral areas (e.g. AB for Clades I–V; Fig. 1),
indicating that the ancestor occurred in two regions simultaneously. In these cases, we used the clade’s age as the colonization
time for both regions. In other cases, an extant species represented a region’s oldest colonization. We calculated the colonization time as half the species’ age in these cases.
The primary analyses were based on the oldest colonization
time for each region. However, multiple invasions of the same
region occurred in some cases. Therefore, we examined the relationship between species richness and summed ages of colonization of each region (e.g. Stephens & Wiens, 2003; Hutter et al.,
2013). Thus, regions that have been colonized many times (and
less recently) were given added weight. We included widespread,
extant species in these calculations also.
Finally, the species in our phylogeny do not encompass all
Lysimachieae species, nor all species in all regions (Table 1). Even
though our species sampling in each region is proportional to its
total richness (see above), and all regions have > 40% sampling
(Table 1), some colonizations may still have been missed. However, unsampled colonizations may be particularly unlikely to
have high richness in a region (all other things being equal, more
species-rich clades are more likely to be sampled). Therefore,
unsampled colonizations seem unlikely to be the oldest or most
influential in a region. Furthermore, our primary analyses used
the oldest colonization time, so failure to include later colonization events will have no impact on the results.
Diversification hypothesis
We examined the relationship between species richness of each
region and the diversification rates of clades that occurred there.
We first divided the species in each region into previously recognized, nonoverlapping, endemic higher taxa (e.g. genera, subgenera, species groups). We selected higher taxa to represent the
largest monophyletic groups in each region (Table S13). If a clade
had only one species in the region (regardless of its global richness), we assigned the clade a rate of zero. Our concern is only
with the clade’s richness in that region (and alternative
approaches should have very little impact, given our weighting
scheme). We then calculated the species richness for each named
clade, assuming that species unsampled in our tree also belonged
to these higher taxa, given their apparent monophyly based on
sampled species. We estimated net diversification rates for each
clade using the method-of-moments estimator for stem-group
ages (Magallon & Sanderson, 2001) using GEIGER version
2.0.6 (Harmon et al., 2008). The stem-group estimator is more
accurate than the crown-group estimator, especially when taxon

Fig. 1 Phylogeny and biogeographic reconstructions for Lysimachieae. The tree is maximum clade-credibility tree (from BEAST), estimated with the root date
based on Strijk et al. (2014). The inset map indicates the geographic regions used in the biogeographic analyses. Colors indicate regions only. Ancestral
areas were inferred by the dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis (DEC) model (in RASP 3.2). Colored branches and squares on nodes indicate ancestral areas.
Colored squares at tips indicate current distributions of each species (Supporting Information Table S2). Main clades were represented with Latin numbers
that are also shown in Fig. S1.

sampling is incomplete (Meyer & Wiens, 2018). This method
uses clade ages, species richness, and a correction for failing to
sample extinct clades (relative extinction fraction ɛ). We initially
used an intermediate ɛ of 0.45, but found that very low and high
values (ɛ = 0, ɛ = 0.90) gave similar results. The diversification
rate for Australasia was treated as zero since there was no in situ
diversification there (no endemic species or sister species). Importantly, the approach used here to estimate diversification rates
incorporates all species in each clade (included in the phylogeny
or not), and only requires sampling one species per clade.
To estimate a single diversification rate for regions with multiple clades, we weighted the diversification rate for each clade by
multiplying it by its proportional richness in the region (the
clade’s richness in that region divided by the region’s total richness). Thus, clades with more species in a region had more weight
than clades with fewer species in that region. These weighted
rates were then summed across clades to yield the weighted diversification rate for the region. Finally, we tested the relationship
between the current richness of each region and its weighted
diversification rate using linear regression in R. Again, we did not
correct for phylogeny in these region-based analyses.
Some studies have stated that the rate estimator used here
requires constant rates within clades and a positive relationship
between richness and clade ages (e.g. Rabosky et al., 2012). However, these studies did not address this estimator’s accuracy. New
simulations show that it can be reasonably accurate regardless of
the relationship between clade age and richness (Kozak & Wiens,
2016) and regardless of whether rates are homogeneous or
heterogeneous within the clade (Meyer & Wiens, 2018). Furthermore, the net diversification rate depends only on the age and
richness of clades. Thus, a young clade with many species will
have a high net diversification rate (and an older clade with few
species a low rate), regardless of variation in instantaneous rates
within the clade (either over time or among subclades). Simulations that include diversity dependence (i.e. rates changing over

time) show that diversification rates still strongly predict richness
patterns (Pontarp & Wiens, 2017). Nevertheless, the method-ofmoments estimator does not estimate separate speciation and
extinction rates.
To estimate speciation and extinction rates in each region, we
used the Multiple State Speciation Extinction (MuSSE) model
implemented in the R package DIVERSITREE (FitzJohn, 2012). We
did not use GEOSSE (Goldberg et al., 2011) here because it only
allows analysis of two regions, and we analyzed six here. We used
one state to represent each region. Australasia was excluded
because it lacks endemic species. Species present in more than
one region were coded based on their inferred ancestral region.
Three parameters were included for each region (state): a speciation rate k, an extinction rate l, and a transition rate between different regions q. We compared the relative fit of the data with
eight likelihood models, each with different combinations of
parameters that were either free to vary among regions or constrained to be equal among regions: (1) k free, l free, and q free
(i.e. separate values for each parameter estimated for each region);
(2) k equal between all regions, l free, and q free; (3) k equal, l
equal, and q free; (4) k equal, l equal, and q equal; (5) k free, l
equal, and q equal; (6) k equal, l free, and q equal; (7) k free, l
free, and q equal; and (8) k free, l equal, and q free. We compared their relative fit using the size-corrected AIC (AICc) (Burnham & Anderson, 2002). The Chi-squared distribution (ChiSq)
and their significance (Pr) were calculated by comparison with
the minimal model. We accounted for incomplete sampling in
our tree for each region using a sampling fraction for each region
(species in our tree in each region divided by the total number
known in each region; Table 2). We estimated the posterior density distribution of parameters for the best-fitting model with
Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analyses (100 000 steps) to
estimate speciation, extinction, and dispersal rates.
We also used these estimated speciation and extinction rates
from MuSSE as an alternative approach to estimating the overall

diversification rate for each region. Importantly, this did not
require assigning species to clades, nor calculating a weighted
index among clades within a region. Australasia was assigned zero
(see earlier).
Although some concerns have been raised about SSE methods
(e.g. Maddison & FitzJohn, 2015; Rabosky & Goldberg, 2015),
we show that our diversification rate estimates from MuSSE are
similar to those from an alternative method (method-ofmoments estimator). Therefore, it seems unlikely that issues of
overall model fit are relevant here.
Combining diversification and time
We also developed a simple index that combines the effects of
time and diversification rate. For this index, we simply multiplied
the time (first colonization age or summed ages) by the net diversification rate (weighted net diversification rate or regional diversification rate from MuSSE) for each region.
Finally, in order to test the effects of different tree priors, calibration points, and epsilon values on our hypotheses (i.e. time,
diversification-rate and combined-effect hypotheses), we performed these analyses on all alternative trees with full sampling
and with different epsilon values. For brevity, results in the main
text used only the primary tree and the intermediate epsilon.

Results

Dating results based on these different strategies were all very
similar to each other (Tables S8, S9). Our primary analyses
(Fig. 1) used the full tree with the Yule prior, all calibration
points, and the stem-age calibration with the intermediate age
(from Strijk et al., 2014). Stem ages of the 11 major clades estimated using different calibrations, reduced taxon sampling, and
alternate tree priors were similar and tightly related to those from
this baseline tree (r2 = 0.93–0.99; Table S10).
Biogeographic reconstructions
Biogeographic analyses primarily used the tree with the intermediate root age and Yule speciation tree prior. We compared the
fit of different constraints on the maximum number of ancestral
regions for each node using likelihood ratio, v2, and AIC tests
(Table S15). The best-fitting model in the DEC analysis (maximum two areas per ancestral species; Table S15) was used in the
main analyses. Biogeographic inferences using a highly constrained transition matrix (Table S14) were basically identical to
those without these assumptions (Table S12). However, the
model utilizing these constraints had somewhat better fit
(loge L = 123.774 vs loge L = 126.619; Tables S12, S14). Biogeographic inferences are illustrated in Fig. 1. These analyses suggest that the ancestor of Lysimachieae most likely occurred in
both North America and Europe, and then dispersed to other
regions (i.e. Africa, East Asia and Central–South America).

Phylogenetic relationships

Time, diversification rate, and species richness

The combined matrix consisted of 13 462 aligned base pairs for
131 species (including five outgroups). The likelihood, Bayesian,
and BEAST topologies were similar and are summarized in Figs 1
and S1–S3. We identified 11 major clades in Lysimachieae with
strong support (Fig. 1), which were concordant with major clades
found in other recent studies (Hao et al., 2004; Anderberg et al.,
2007; Manns & Anderberg, 2011). Our results strongly resolved
the relationships of these major clades except for two nodes
(Fig. 1). The first weakly supported relationship (bootstrap/posterior probability values: 65/0.86; Fig. S1) is among the monotypic
genus ‘Glaux’ (Clade III) and two other Lysimachia clades (Clades
I and II). Previous studies found similarly weak support for these
relationships (Hao et al., 2004; Anderberg et al., 2007). The second weak relationship (bootstrap/posterior probability values: 74/
0.69; Fig. S1) is among Clade VII, Clade VIII, and Clades I–VI.
Clade VII is sister to other ‘Anagallis’ taxa (Clade VI) in Manns
& Anderberg (2005). However, we placed Clade VII with Clades
I–VI (‘Glaux’ and all Lyismachia except the endemic Lysimachia
group in the New World), but with only moderate support.

Results here are based on the tree using the intermediate root age
and Yule speciation tree prior. Other trees yielded similar results
(Table S16). For each region, the current species richness, oldest
colonization time, and summed colonization times are listed in
Table 1. There was no significant relationship between current
species richness and the oldest colonization time among regions
(r2 = 0.121, P = 0.446; Fig. 2a), nor between richness and
summed colonization ages (r2 = 0.022, P = 0.750; Fig. 2b).
Importantly, the ancestral regions (Europe and North America)
for Lysimachieae have only 22 and 19 species respectively
(Table 1). Other regions (Africa, Hawaii, South America, and
Australia) have younger colonization times and low species richness. By contrast, East Asia has a relatively old colonization time
and the highest species richness (Table 1). Therefore, Europe and
North America act as outliers in these analyses, weakening any
positive relationship between age and richness. The time–richness
relationship is relatively strong when these two areas are removed
(r2 = 0.809, P = 0.038, using oldest colonization times), but not
significant using summed colonization ages (r2 = 0.637,
P = 0.106; Fig. S9). Thus, time seems to contribute to the high
species richness of East Asia, despite the lack of a time–richness
relationship among regions overall.
The relationship between the weighted diversification rate of
each region (stem-group estimator, ɛ = 0.45) and its regional
species richness was also nonsignificant (r2 = 0.207, P = 0.306,
Fig. 2c). The lack of a significant relationship may be explained
by two regions (Hawaii and Africa) having low richness but

Divergence-time estimation
Similar time estimates and topologies were obtained using three
different calibration ages and different tree priors for the stem age
of Lysimachieae (Figs 1, S2–S8; Tables S8, S14). We also tested
the effect of incomplete sampling on divergence-time estimation
using a tree with only 10% of all species included (26 species).

relatively high diversification rates. For example, Hawaii has
only 18 Lysimachieae species (mainly Lysimachia subgenus
Lysimachiopsis) but a high diversification rate (0.2544 species/
Myr). The rate and richness are similar in the African clade
(0.2322, Table 1). A strong relationship between regional richness and diversification rate was supported after removing
Hawaii and Africa (r2 = 0.960, P = 0.003; Fig. S9). East Asia has
a relatively high diversification rate (0.2147), which seemingly
helps explain its high species richness. Relationships were similar
using diversification rates estimated with ɛ of 0 and 0.90
(Fig. S10).
We also tested the hypothesis that time and diversification
rates act together to explain richness patterns among regions. To
test this combined effect, we simply multiplied the weighted
diversification rate (ɛ = 0.45) for each region by its oldest colonization time. We found a strong relationship between regional
species richness and this combined effect (r2 = 0.855, P = 0.003,

Fig. 3a). This relationship remains strong when East Asia is
removed (r2 = 0.809, P = 0.006).
The best-fitting MuSSE model supported different speciation
rates but equal extinction and transition rates among regions
(AICc = 788.788, loge L = 386.394, Table S17). Under this
model, speciation rates in each region are as follows: East Asia,
0.3520; Europe, 0.1505; Africa, 0.2641; North America, 0.2162;
Central–South America, 0.1332; and Hawaii, 0.8727
(Table S18). Thus, the highest speciation rates are in Hawaii and
East Asia. However, the second-best model (model 6, AICc =
793.577, loge L = 383.788) has a similar fit to the best model
(dAICc = 4.789), and allows both speciation and extinction rates
to vary (Tables S17, S19). This difference is close to the standard
cutoff for model selection (Burnham & Anderson, 2002). Speciation rates under the two models (best-fitting and second-best) are
very similar (r2 = 0.979, P = 0.0002), but extinction rates vary
under the second-best model. Using this latter model

(Table S19), Europe (0.1515) and North America (0.2665) have
higher extinction rates than East Asia (0.1228) and Africa
(0.0794). MuSSE analyses with alternative trees showed model 4
(best-fitting model) and model 6 (second-best) had a similar fit
(Table S20). Net diversification rates (k l) for each region calculated by MuSSE (using the model with variable speciation and
extinction rates among regions) were broadly similar to the
weighted net diversification rates estimated for these regions (using ɛ = 0.45; r2 = 0.673, P = 0.024; Tables 1, 2). Hawaii had an
extremely high net diversification rate using MuSSE (0.6691) relative to the weighted net diversification rate (0.2544; Tables 1,
2). When Hawaii is removed, the relationship is very strong
(r2 = 0.863, P = 0.022). There was no significant relationship
between the net diversification rate for each region from MuSSE
and each region’s species richness (r2 = 0.034, P = 0.693,
Fig. 2d). Results were similar under the model in which only speciation rates differed (r2 = 0.001, P = 0.944). However, there was
a significant relationship between the species richness of each
region and the combined index of time and MuSSE-estimated
diversification rates (under the model with different speciation
and extinction rates; r2 = 0.945, P = 0.001, Fig. 3b). Results were
significant but weaker with East Asia removed (r2 = 0.767,
P = 0.022). Results were also similar but somewhat weaker
(r2 = 0.712, P = 0.017) using the model with only speciation rates
that differ among regions (Fig. 3c).

Discussion
What explains the high species richness of plants in East Asia relative to other temperate regions? This is a long-standing question,
New Phytologist (2018) 219: 436–448
www.newphytologist.com

but no studies have tested both time and diversification rates as
potential explanations. Our results for Lysimachieae suggest that
this pattern is explained by the combination of time and diversification rates, rather than one or the other. Specifically, East Asia
has been colonized for a relatively long period of time by Lysimachieae, and also has relatively high net diversification rates
compared with other regions. However, in our analyses, neither
factor alone explains high richness in East Asia. In the paragraphs
that follow, we discuss the importance of this combined explanation. We then discuss future work, which should address two
major questions: (1) What ecological factors explain the evolutionary and biogeographic patterns found? (2) Do results for
Lysimachieae apply to other plant groups in East Asia?
Our results suggest that high species richness in East Asia in
Lysimachieae is explained by a combination of time and relatively
high diversification rates. Neither variable alone explained richness patterns among regions. Specifically, even though East Asia
has been colonized for a relatively long period of time relative to
most other regions, Europe and North America have been colonized longer and yet are relatively species poor. Therefore, based
on time alone, Europe and North America should have the highest richness. Similarly, even though East Asia has a relatively high
weighted net diversification rate (much higher than Europe or
North America), both Hawaii and Africa have higher rates. However, Hawaii and Africa were both colonized relatively recently,
and therefore their high net diversification rates have not yet
yielded high species richness. Overall, neither time nor diversification rates explained richness patterns among regions. Yet, a
weighted measure that incorporates both time and diversification
rates provides a strong explanation for richness patterns among

Phytologist
regions, especially the high richness of East Asia relative to other
regions. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use such a
combined measure. Interestingly, many previous studies on richness patterns tend to favor time over diversification rates (e.g.
Hutter et al., 2013; Wiens et al., 2013), whereas others favor
diversification rates over time (e.g. Pyron & Wiens, 2013; Wiens,
2015). Few have found that both explain richness patterns (e.g.
Smith et al., 2007), although such a pattern is not unexpected
based on theory (e.g. Pontarp & Wiens, 2017). Our results here
strongly reinforce the need to test the influence of both time and
diversification rates on spatial richness patterns. Moreover, our
results suggest that the combined effects of these variables should
also be considered in cases (like ours) in which neither variable
explains richness patterns on its own.
It is important to note that these combined effects of time and
diversification rates are not an inevitable explanation for richness
patterns. Specifically, if we were attempting to explain richness
patterns among clades only (e.g. genera), then it is true that multiplying the age of the clade by its net diversification rate should
yield that clade’s observed number of species. However, this is not
so straightforward for spatial richness patterns among regions. For
example, the weighted net diversification rate for the region is
based on the age of each named clade (not how long they have
been present in each region), weighted by the number of clades in
each region, the number of species from each clade in the region,
and the global diversification rate of each clade. Conversely, the
age of a clade in a region (i.e. oldest colonization time) is not necessarily the same as the age used to estimate the diversification rate.
Therefore, we strongly emphasize that the strong relationship
observed here between species richness and our combined measure
of colonization time and diversification rate is not inevitable.
Our results help identify the combination of evolutionary and
biogeographic processes (i.e. speciation, extinction, colonization
time) that explain high species richness in East Asia (Axelrod et al.,
1996; Xiang et al., 2004). We suggest that a high priority for
future research should be to identify the specific ecological factors
that act on these processes (e.g. Guo et al., 1998; Qian & Ricklefs,
2000; Qian, 2002; Wang et al., 2009, 2011). For example, our
results suggest that patterns of species richness in Lysimachieae are
explained by relatively high speciation rates in East Asia, the highest of any region except Hawaii (Tables S10, S16). Therefore,
future work should seek to explain what causes high speciation
rates in these regions. We suggest that the radiation of Lysimachieae across diverse elevations and associated climatic regimes
in both regions may be important (Chen & Hu, 1979; Oh et al.,
2013). The high diversification rate of Hawaii may also result (at
least in part) from ecological opportunity associated with the
absence of some potentially competing mainland plant clades, as
suggested by the ecological theory of adaptive radiation (Schluter,
2000). However, this hypothesis will require additional analyses
to elucidate (e.g. has there been greater ecological diversification
in Hawaii? are there fewer relevant clades that might compete with
them?). Our second-best MuSSE model (Table S17) also suggests
that Lysimacheae in North America experienced relatively high
extinction rates, which substantially lowered their net diversification rates. By contrast, Europe and East Asia share relatively

modest extinction rates. One potential explanation for the high
extinction rates in North America is the combined effects of
glaciation in northern regions and aridification in western regions
(Latham & Ricklefs, 1993; Qian & Ricklefs, 2000; Eronen et al.,
2012; Ricklefs & He, 2016). Surprisingly, Hawaii appears to have
the highest extinction rates of any region, but its very high speciation rate seems to compensate for the dampening effects of this
high extinction on net diversification rates.
Our results also show that area and latitude may not be the
most important factors driving richness patterns. In Lysimacheae,
species richness in East Asia is higher than the combined richness
of Europe, North America, Central–South America, and Australasia (Table 1), despite the much greater area of these combined regions. Furthermore, these species-poor regions include
low-latitude tropical regions (e.g. Africa, Central–South America). We suggest that area and latitude may only impact richness
if there is sufficient time to build up richness in each region.
A second major question from our study is whether our results
for Lysimachieae are representative of all plant groups in East
Asia. Our underlying goal is to understand why East Asia has
such high plant richness overall (e.g. Qian & Ricklefs, 2000). We
addressed this question using Lysimachieae as a model system.
However, we recognize that this tribe may not be fully representative of all groups of plants that contribute to high East Asian
species richness. That being said, we do not know of any potentially relevant way in which Lysimachieae is different from other
species-rich plant groups in the region. For example, the tribe has
been considered a typical group with high species richness in East
Asia (Chen & Hu, 1979; Li, 1996; St
ahl & Anderberg, 2004). In
addition, the tribe has many characteristics that are widespread in
other large Chinese plant groups (e.g. Primula, Gentiana,
Saxifraga, and Pedicularis; Li, 1996). These characteristics include
herbaceous growth form, insect pollination, no long-distance dispersal ability, and mesic habitat (St
ahl & Anderberg, 2004). Nevertheless, we think that the best way to address whether our
results are representative or not is to do similar analyses in other
groups with high species richness in East Asia, and see whether
they have patterns similar to those found here for Lysimachieae.
In summary, our study helps reveal the underlying causes of
high plant species richness in East Asia. In the tribe Lysimachieae,
this pattern is caused by both relatively long occurrence in the
region (time-for-speciation effect) and relatively high net diversification rates in the clades that occur there. Importantly, neither
variable alone fully explains this pattern. More broadly, our
results demonstrate the importance of testing the combined
effects of time and diversification, and the need to test both
hypotheses (and possibly their interaction) to explain large-scale
patterns of species richness.
