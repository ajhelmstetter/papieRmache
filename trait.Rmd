each species as is) had little effect on the results. we therefore used the generic level coding approach for subsequent analyses. the 100 trees generated above were combined with the trait dataset of growth forms. the classe model is a derived model of the binary state speciation and extinction model (bisse) (maddison et al., 2007). the classe model has ten parameters (figure 1): two cladogenetic speciation rates without character change associated with the non-climbing habit (0) [Î»000 ; the abbreviation means that one lineage with state 0 gives two lineages with state 0 and 0 (000)] and the climbing habit (1)

us to assess the robustness of the observed differences. phylogenetic clustering on the other hand would be expected not only for traits with no impact on divergence but also in cases where traits represent a key innovation. therefore, we tested the effect of each trait on diversification rates using the bisse ln likelihood test (maddison et al. 2007) implemented in mesquite (maddison and maddison 2008). the test calculates the likelihood and parameter estimates of a six-parameter model consisting of speciation, extinction, and character shift rates for both states of a binary trait. for the calculations, each trait was scored as a

table 3), pollinator shifts between sister species occur significantly less frequently than based on our randomizations, revealing again a pattern of phylogenetic clustering, with a low frequency of shifts between sister species (moraea 0.25, p < 0.001; podalyrieae 0, p < 0.001; protea 0.231, p < 0.001; table 3). the bisse ln likelihood test yielded no significant differences in speciation or extinction rates for any of the traits analyzed (table s4). as direct comparisons of the proportion of sisterspecies differences (jsis ) between lineages and between downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/60/3/343/1666085 by guest on 02 march 2020 to cryptic speciation, we excluded the
