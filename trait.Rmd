new world species. old world and new world species represent 78% and 22% of our phylogeny respectively. this ratio is comparable to the ratio of the whole tribe (77% old world species, 23% new world species). next, we examined how pollination mode correlates with diversiﬁcation rates in antirrhineae using the \"bisse\" function (binary state speciation and extinction; maddison et al., 2007) within the r package diversitree (fitzjohn, 2012). we coded bee pollination as 0, and hummingbird pollination as 1. we estimated speciation rates in taxa with both traits (λ0, λ1), extinction rates in taxa with both traits (μ0, μ1), and character

and the new world extinction rates were shown to be zero. dispersals were only observed from the old world to the new world. no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in extinction or dispersal rates between the two regions was observed (fig. 7). in terms of the eﬀects of pollination mode on diversiﬁcation rates, bisse analysis showed that the rates of speciation, extinction, and character shifts were not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between bee pollinated and hummingbird pollinated lineages in antirrhineae, and that employing diﬀerent settings that incorporated the potential for sampling bias did not have any eﬀect on the results (table 3). 43 perspectives in plant
