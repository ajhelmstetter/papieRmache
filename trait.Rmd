each species as is) had little effect on the results. we therefore used the generic level coding approach for subsequent analyses. the 100 trees generated above were combined with the trait dataset of growth forms. the classe model is a derived model of the binary state speciation and extinction model (bisse) (maddison et al., 2007). the classe model has ten parameters (figure 1): two cladogenetic speciation rates without character change associated with the non-climbing habit (0) [Î»000 ; the abbreviation means that one lineage with state 0 gives two lineages with state 0 and 0 (000)] and the climbing habit (1)
