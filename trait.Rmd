angiosperms or were there phases of markedly different range shift rates and directionality? (2) is high diversity correlated with high speciation and/or low extinction? more specifically, were there significant differences in speciation and extinction rates between tropical and non-tropical zones, and among tropical regions? in such case, are the most species rich regions also those with highest speciation and/or lowest extinction? in evolutionary biology and biogeography (see e.g., pianka, 1966; hillebrand, 2004; jablonski et al., 2006; wiens et al., 2006; brown, 2014; huang et al., 2014; kerkhoff et al., 2014; mannion et al., 2014; rolland et al., 2014). there are three

intrinsic eco-physiological constraints (niche conservatism; kerkhoff et al., 2014). a second striking feature of tropical biodiversity, besides being consistently higher than in non-tropical regions, is its uneven distribution among the three tropical regions of the world. for instance, it has been suggested that the american tropics (the neotropics) comprise more species of seed plants than tropical africa and tropical asia together, with similar patterns for other organismal groups such as amphibians, mammals, birds, nymphalid butterflies, and reptiles (govaerts, 2001; antonelli, 2008; antonelli and sanmart√≠n, 2011 and",

collections (amongst others) could also play important roles. evaluating the validity and relative roles of the factors driving these fundamental biodiversity differences requires combining evidence from several sources and disciplines, such as palaeontology, ecology and molecular phylogenetics. among these, two main components stand out as essential in this pursuit: understanding species diversification (i.e., the interplay between speciation and extinction) and the geographic history of lineages. in this study we explore these two components at a global and continental scale. we focus on the cenozoic history (i.e., the last 66 ma) of flowering plants (angiosperms), which form the dominant structure of tropical

neotropical angiosperms speciated on average about 2 - 2.5 times faster than angiosperms in tropical asia and tropical africa. however, they also went extinct about 2 - 2.5 times faster than in tropical asia. these high rates of speciation and extinction in the neotropics indicate a rapid evolutionary turnover, i.e., species being formed and replacing each other at an unparalleled rate. this result is also in accordance to the observation that south american plant diversity is characterized by a relatively large number of recent, species-rich radiations, for instance in the tropical andes (hughes and eastwood, 2006; drummond et al., 2012; madri√±√°n

among the regions outlined. this is because biological sampling is far from being random, with an over-representation of deep nodes that reflect morphological and geographical variations in taxa (hohna et al., 2011; ter steege et al., 2011; cusimano et al., 2012). in other words, even if only a couple of species were sampled from a speciesrich but strictly african clade, our analyses should be able to detect when that clade arrived in africa. further simulations would be helpful to assess at which sampling levels the calculation of continental-level range shifts stabilize and become fully reliable. diversification rates of angiosperms have varied

angiosperm phylogeny was at or below 10% for all tropical regions (figure 3, table 3). sampling levels already below c. 80% are bound to flaw diversification rate estimates under current methods, often showing slowdowns in net diversification that represent methodological artifacts (cusimano and renner, 2010). expectations on how the missing species are distributed in a phylogeny depending on the sampling scheme may increase the accuracy of diversification analyses (stadler and bokma, 2013). however, no method has been developed so far that is capable of confidently dealing with the level of taxonomic sampling observed in the angiosperm phylogeny we used. the musse

the inevitable incompleteness of the fossil record represents a limit to macro-evolutionary analyses that can be carried out using currently available data. however, the development of new methods has shown that even incomplete fossil data can provide essential information in estimating trends of phenotypic evolution (slater and harmon, 2013) and species diversification dynamics (silvestro et al., 2014). such models should be ideally extended to historical biogeography and might shed new light on the dynamics of migration of lineages through time and among regions. in particular, fossils provide an important resource for improving biogeographic reconstructions, as they provide information on past species

and succulence in arid environments (ogburn and edwards, 2010; arakaki et al., 2011). these and others examples demonstrate that similar habitats or micro-habitats can produce selective pressures that favor some morphological and physiological traits. another evolutionary process, sometimes linked with convergence, is the diversification of ecological roles among closely related species, i.e., divergent evolution, which results in the exploitation of different ecological resources (e.g., bramwell, 1975; givnish et al., 2009, 2014). convergent and divergent evolution have been attributed to morpho-physiological traits, whose gradual evolution or rapid innovation can lead to adaptive radiation, sometimes involving increased diversification rates (givnish and sytsma, 1997;

evolutionary processes underlying plant evolution (bateman, 1994, 1999; sussex and kerk, 2001; meyerberthaud et al., 2010). architectural studies have shown that plants are modular organisms comprising elements that can differ in their organization and functions (hall√© et al., 1978; barth√©l√©my and caraglio, 2007). for instance, in many tree and treelet species, the trunk functions primarily for exploration and to provide support, while branches are involved in assimilation and reproduction. plant architecture thus influences spatial and temporal exploitation of resources (smith et al., 2014). some architectural traits have been shown to impact plant fitness, either directly (k√ºppers, 1989; millet et al., 1999;

(givnish, 2016). new caledonia exhibits both components of divergent selection: (i) climatically permissive rainforests and (ii) ecological opportunities offered by recent climatic fluctuations. divergent selection, caused by competition among closely related taxa, leads to adaptive radiation, i.e., the rise of a diversity of ecological roles and related adaptations in different species among a lineage (givnish, 2016). the theory of niche preemption holds that adaptive radiation creates a barrier that inhibits the establishment of closely related taxa, thus reducing the likelihood of repeated colonization. clearly highlights evolutionary processes behind architectural transitions and their link to plant ecological strategy and perhaps also to

the implications of architectural variation on plant fitness under different environmental conditions. based on such an index, our study provides a functional definition of monocauly that is ecologically and evolutionary more explicit than one based solely on physiognomy (cf. hall√© et al., 1978; chomicki et al., 2017): we define monocaulous species as woody plants whose cardinal functions (e.g., assimilation and exploration) rely on a single apparent stem. although our work focused on a small clade, it opens new perspectives and proposes a general framework for further understanding evolution of plant architecture and its functional implications in other plant groups and other

(gentry, 1991). across species from different woody plant families, abundance of climbers in tropical forests is negatively correlated with mean annual precipitation and positively with seasonality, peaking in tropical dry forests (schnitzer, 2005). however, regional studies of climber abundance do not necessarily support such results and suggest that structural characteristics of the forests can

present-day climate (i.e., contemporary climate minus paleoclimate). large positive anomaly values indicate a higher precipitation and temperature in the present than in the past whereas small or negative anomaly values indicate the opposite, i.e., higher precipitation and temperature in the past than in the present. hence, a negative relationship between species richness and climate anomalies indicates that species richness is higher in areas that were relatively wetter or warmer in the past than 1 http://pmip2.lsce.ipsl.fr/ frontiers in genetics | evolutionary and population genetics evolution of climbing palms today. tdwg level 3 unit values for lgm precipitation and temperature were calculated as

consistent with Ô¨Åndings on global palm diversity patterns (kissling et al., 2012a). this relationship reÔ¨Çects the limited physiological and functional adaptations of palms, which reduce their survival in areas with cold climates (tomlinson, 2006). however, the missing effect of temperature seasonality and the observed negative effect of precipitation seasonality on species richness of climbers are opposite to that of non-climbers (table 2). the negative correlation with precipitation seasonality also contrasts with woody climbing plants, which increase (rather than decrease) in diversity with precipitation seasonality (schnitzer, 2005). these trends could be explained by climbing palms being mostly found within calamoideae, a subfamily

higher forests have a more patchy canopy because they have larger gaps in between tree trunks and fewer large trees reaching maximum heights (e.g., dipterocarp forests, see below, richards, 1996). second, larger trees can lead to larger tree-fall gaps, which has been shown to maintain a higher diversity of climber species in general (putz, 1984; schnitzer and carson, 2001). however, in contrast to nonmonocot lianas (schnitzer, 2005) the majority of climbing palms might be less tolerant of strong disturbances. this is probably also reÔ¨Çected in the negative relationship of palm species richness with prec seas (table 2), which is opposite to

(baker et al., 2000a; isnard, 2006). comparative studies of anatomical characters between calaminae (calamus and daemonorops) and desmoncus and subtribe plectocomiinae (although based on the study of a few species) suggest that the evolution of a more Ô¨Çexible stem within subtribe calaminae could explain the outstanding diversiÔ¨Åcation of this group in terms of climbing mechanics (rowe et al., 2004; isnard, 2006). in addition, the evolution of a unique climbing organ (the Ô¨Çagellum, a modiÔ¨Åed inÔ¨Çorescence) has taken place within calamus

a unique climbing organ (the Ô¨Çagellum, a modiÔ¨Åed inÔ¨Çorescence) has taken place within calamus (dransÔ¨Åeld et al., 2008) and might have provided an additional advantage over other climbing structures in palms. moreover, the presence of a \"knee\" a swelling at the junction of the leaf sheath and petiole, in most species in subtribe calaminae and, to some extent, the african genus eremospatha has been suggested as a potentially important trait for enhancing leaf strength at this important stress point (isnard and rowe, 2008). overall, the repeated homoplasious occurrence of the climbing habit in the calamoideae ('clustered homoplasy') could also indicate a

grapnel spines on climbing organs. finally, some life history traits might also act against increasing diversiÔ¨Åcation rates. indeed, plectocomiinae and the genera korthalsia (korthalsiinae, figure 4c) and laccosperma (ancistrophyllinae, figure 4d) are hapaxanthic (individual stems die after a single Ô¨Çowering event), a condition which is generally not associated with high species richness across palms (dransÔ¨Åeld et al., 2008). thus, several morphological novelties of subtribe calaminae absent from other climbing genera (more Ô¨Çexible stems, the evolution of a Ô¨Çagellum in calamus, the better mechanical role of the leaf sheath under stress, and the presence of a knee) possibly played decisive functional roles

the evolution of a Ô¨Çagellum in calamus, the better mechanical role of the leaf sheath under stress, and the presence of a knee) possibly played decisive functional roles in explaining the diversiÔ¨Åcation of this group when compared to other climbing palms. explaining geographic differences in diversiÔ¨Åcation rates (e.g., numerous climbing species in southeast asia vs. few in the neotropics) might be related to the fact that a particular trait only increases diversiÔ¨Åcation rates under certain environmental conditions (de queiroz, 2002). for instance, a highly dynamic geographic setting linked to a complex biogeographic history of southeast asia (hall, 2009) might be important

al., 2011) as well as the start of its estimated radiation in the region (morley, 2000) correspond to the timing of increased diversiÔ¨Åcation rates within the calamoideae (oligocene to early miocene). we therefore hypothesize that the diversiÔ¨Åcation of dipterocarps in combination with the evolution of several morpho-anatomical traits in calaminae species could have triggered the radiation of climbing palms in this region. ecological opportunity responses of one clade based on the success of another have been suggested in other cases such as ferns (schneider et al., 2004) or ants (moreau et al., 2006) during the radiation of angiosperms. conclusion global diversity

level, either because fewer offspring are produced or because a large production of seeds is carried by a limited number of individuals, thus increasing offspring competition (janzen, 1971; maynard-smith, 1978; bawa, 1980; heilbuth et al., 2001; charlesworth, 2009). however, some of these costs are expected to be similar for animal species with separate sexes, which are nonetheless numerous, and the rareness of dioecious plants requires further explanation. apart from the debate over whether or not the ancestor of the angiosperms had bisexual flowers (e.g. endress & doyle, 2009), no reasonable doubt seems to exist about the fact that bisexual flowers occurred

dispersed by animals, a tropical distribution, abiotic pollination, small or inconspicuous flowers or inflorescences, and an arborescent growth form (e.g. bawa, 1980; renner & ricklefs, 1995), could be explained by the fact that selection for separate sexes should be particularly strong when associated with these traits. for example, abiotically pollinated species are thought to face a high risk of selfing (lloyd & yates, 1982; cox & grubb, 1991), which should increase selection for dioecy. nevertheless, the relative rareness of dioecy in plants helped establish the idea that it is deleterious for plants in the long run. an angiosperm-wide study of the

recently, k‚Ç¨afer & mousset (2014) revisited the relatively simple sister clade comparison framework for its applicability to derived traits, such as dioecy. heilbuth's (2000) conclusion that dioecious clades diversify less was based on the expectation that, under equal diversification rates, the two sister clades in each pair should be equally species rich. this expectation is indeed the one commonly used in sister clade comparisons (e.g. slowinski & guyer, 1993; wiegmann et al., 1993; mooers & moller, 1996; heilbuth, 2000; davies et al., 2004; davis et al., 2010): if two groups originate from the 1479 same ancestor and diversify at equal rates,

heilbuth's (2000) data did not distinguish between transitions to and reversions from dioecy, this could explain why k‚Ç¨afer & mousset detected increased diversification associated with dioecy. furthermore, heilbuth constructed her data set to be conservative in accordance with her hypothesis that dioecious clades diversify less, by excluding genera containing dioecious species that occur in the sister clades and by including hermaphrodites that occur in the dioecious clades. thus, when testing the inverse hypothesis that dioecious clades diversify more, heilbuth's data set is not conservative anymore as it tends to overestimate the species richness of the dioecious clades compared to their sisters.

discussion dioecy increases diversification k‚Ç¨ afer & mousset (2014) showed that it is important to distinguish between derived and ancestral states of a trait in sister clade comparisons; ignoring this distinction leads to high type i error rates in statistical tests and could lead one to wrongly attribute differences in species richness to differences in diversification rates. they proposed a new test for sister clade comparisons to study the effect of derived character states. in the current study, we present a data set of dioecious clades and their nondioecious sister clades, tailored for the requirements of this test, that is, including

is, including only clade pairs for which the ancestral state could be assigned as nondioecious with sufficient confidence. using the resampling test k‚Ç¨ afer & mousset proposed, we confirm their conclusion that dioecy seems to increase diversification moderately. thus, the hypothesis that dioecy is an evolutionary dead end, because dioecious species would suffer from higher extinction and/or lower speciation rates (heilbuth, 2000; barrett, 2002; vamosi et al., 2003), is not supported by our study. nevertheless, our results suggest that dioecy increases diversification rates only moderately, and it cannot be considered a 'key innovation' (hunter, 1998). questions have been raised as to

of our data set is thus on dioecious clades that have survived for some time, and it could be biased if these recent clades are short-lived dioecious clades with low diversification rates. however, it is difficult to imagine that dioecy as a trait that managed to establish itself in a species population has such severe negative effects on diversification that it would drive the clade to extinction immediately upon its establishment, although this remains to be tested. this sister clade comparison test relies on the assumption that the transition to dioecy did not coincide with the split into two sister clades.

the phylogeny by xi et al. (2012) showed that this was also the case for the ancestor of the euphorbiaceae, peraceae and rafflesiaceae. furthermore, we identified 38 families for which dioecy most probably was ancestral (see tables s1 and s2). some of these families have only one to a few species, so dioecy could be recent as well, but moderately sized families with ancestral dioecy are not rare (e.g. pandanaceae, restionaceae and menispermaceae have over 500 species). the fact that dioecy is observed 'mostly at the tips of phylogenetic trees' (heilbuth, 2000) was considered as an indication that dioecious clades are

dioecy is seen as a handicap, the ecological and life-history traits to which it is correlated are considered as ways to overcome or avoid this handicap. this is the case for the 'seed shadow handicap', that is, only half of the individuals contribute to the dispersal of seeds in dioecious species (heilbuth et al., 2001). as dispersal through animals leads to different, more efficient dispersal dynamics, this would reduce the effect of the handicap (vamosi et al., 2007) and thus decrease the extinction risk (vamosi & vamosi, 2004). however, and although the result is only marginally significant, we found that dioecious

systems and other traits on plant diversification (goldberg et al., 2010; johnson et al., 2011; mayrose et al., 2011; drummond et al., 2012b; goldberg & igi\002c, 2012; igic & busch, 2013). thus, they could in principle provide important data on the evolution of dioecy and the long-term survival of dioecious species, being a more powerful alternative than the sister clade comparisons we used here. however, a recent investigation by davis et al. (2013) sheds light on the limits of these methods, by showing that the accuracy and precision of parameter estimation of bisse is greatly reduced when one character represents <

< 10% of the taxa at the tips. the main problem thus seems to be intrinsically related to the rareness of dioecy in angiosperms (~6%). we made similar observations in our attempts to use bisse to study the effect of dioecy in the genus silene (caryophyllaceae), a genus with 700 species of which fewer than 20 are dioecious (fig. s2). sister clade comparisons, while they undeniably lack some of the advantages of these methods that are explicitly phylogeny based, are a more robust alternative. the selection of only those groups that present the character of interest, if correctly handled (k‚Ç¨ afer

methods that are explicitly phylogeny based, are a more robust alternative. the selection of only those groups that present the character of interest, if correctly handled (k‚Ç¨ afer & mousset, 2014), enables an increase in statistical power with only a moderate increase in computation time. furthermore, only relative differences in species richness are considered, so that inherent variations in diversification rates of widely divergent clades are automatically corrected for. the statistical inference is parameter- and, to a large extent, distribution free. this, of course, diminishes the statistical power if the correct underlying model can be identified, but provides a better safeguard

species in each dataset as inferred by chromevol and figure s3 presents several representative phylogenies with the inferred polyploidization events. in a number of cases, the ploidy inferences seemed questionable for sub-clades with high proportions of missing 2 chromosome numbers. to be conservative, we changed the ploidy states for these species to \"not available\" (na in the diversitree r package) in our diversification analyses. we note that our methodology for assigning ploidy levels to extant taxa does not account for different diversification rates of diploids and polyploids. this may bias our estimates of ploidy levels among extant taxa, particularly for those

rates of diploids and polyploids. this may bias our estimates of ploidy levels among extant taxa, particularly for those taxa with missing chromosome counts. to verify that this potential bias did not substantively affect our conclusions, we repeated the diversification analysis (detailed below) with ploidy levels assigned only to those species with available cytological data, labeling the missing chromosome count data as na. this procedure yielded very similar results to those reported in the main text. in addition, very similar results were obtained when ploidy-level assignments were not based on the chromevol reconstructions but instead, following stebbins (1), regarding all species

bisse co-estimates six parameters: speciation rates of lineages in state p (polyploid) and d (diploid) (Œªp and Œªd, respectively); extinction rates of lineages in state p and d (¬µp and ¬µd); and transition rates from p to d (qpd) and d to p (qdp). because we defined as polyploid those species that underwent a polyploidization event sometime since divergence from their generic ancestor, we fixed qpd to zero (but see below). this constraint is also compatible with the common assumption that polyploidy is largely an irreversible process, especially over a short time interval (22). our analyses were performed using the \"skeletal\"

in two daughter lineages that survive to the present, similar modifications were made to allow simultaneous speciation with state change along the branches, given that one of the lineages resulting from such speciation events must go extinct before the present and the other lineage must give rise to the descendant species, as observed. the above modifications resulted in the addition of four parameters to form the bisse-ness model: p0c, p0a, p1c, p1a (here state 0 being diploid and state 1 polyploid). here, however, we excluded polyploid to diploid transitions (p1c = 0 and p1a = 0) since in our generic phylogenies

in the bisse or bisse-ness models would imply that it is possible for a taxon to experience a near-instantaneous halving of its genome (i.e., polyhaploidy), which is not widely accepted. instead, diploidization is thought to be a gradual process involving the loss and differentiation of genetic material. in addition, polyploid species were defined in our studies as those lineages that underwent a polyploidization event since divergence from the common ancestor of the group examined. thus, a lineage may be labeled polyploid even if it has a chromosome number and meiotic behavior similar to that inferred for the base of the group

were similar between the two ploidal states (p > 0.1). we thus conclude that only under unrealistically high reversion rates from polyploidy to diploidy would polyploids be likely to diversify at rates that are as high as that inferred for diploids. simulating the number of ancient polyploidization events within angiosperm species we used a two-state (diploid and polyploid) birth and death process to simulate the distribution of the number of genome duplications expected in the evolutionary history of an angiosperm species since its divergence from the most recent common ancestor of angiosperms. in these simulations we assumed that variation in ploidy

then recorded the total number of polyploidization events that occurred in the history of each extant taxon, assuming that a certain fraction of speciation events, fhet, involve polyploidization. we ran this process 100 times, for a given fhet value, starting from a common diploid ancestor until the total number of species reached 300,000, a somewhat conservative estimate of the total number of angiosperm species (25); other estimates ranging from 250,000 to 400,000 gave similar results). under the extent of heteroploid speciation estimated in our study (fhet = 29.7% for angiosperms), our simulations indicated that if polyploids and diploids were diversifying at

with spatial and environmental heterogeneity, unique geological properties, and inÔ¨Çuences from its surrounding Ô¨Çoras, the mediterranean region hosts rich plant diversity (thompson, 2005). therefore, dispersing to a diÔ¨Äerent environment may not be advantageous for the mediterranean clades, because they have traits that are likely adapted for mediterranean conditions. most antirrhineae species have Ô¨Çoral traits that are often linked to bee-pollination. the features of typical antirrhineae Ô¨Çowers include zygomorphy, tubular corollas enclosed by a lip, and nectar containing spurs (ghebrehiwet et al., 2000; guzm√°n et al., 2015). considering the high frequency of these bee-pollination related traits within the tribe, hummingbird pollination may

hummingbird pollination may not be advantageous to a clade that migrated from a bee-dominant region. the emergence of hummingbird pollination in the new world from bee pollinated old world ancestors in the mediterranean was relatively recent in the tribe. therefore, instead of specializing in hummingbird pollination, the new world antirrhineae species may simply incorporate hummingbirds into their pollinator suite and become more generalist. depending on the strength and eÔ¨Éciency of reproductive barriers, sympatric speciation may take a long time, and pollinator p",

2014). it was previously shown that pollinator p", " alone is usually not strong enough to maintain reproductive isolation, and that additional mechanisms may be necessary to form an eÔ¨Äective reproductive barrier between the two diverging populations (gegear and burns, 2007; armbruster, 2014). it would be interesting to investigate hummingbird-pollinated species at population levels to see whether they show any signatures of population structure hinting at early stages of speciation, and if they do, research should focus on whether there are other modes of reproductive isolation along with pollinator p",

in sexual systems, flowering plants provide an ideal group in which to conduct comparative evolutionary analyses to understand the evolution of sexual systems. in particular, there is a long-standing interest in understanding why dioecy is such a rare sexual system in flowering plants, present in only c. 6% of the species (renner, 2014) compared with c. 95% in animals (jarne & auld, 2006). the rarity of a trait (here dioecy) can be explained in a number of ways: it may slow speciation, hasten extinction, be slow to emerge from an ancestral state, or disappear faster than it appears (thomson & brunet,

might be positively selected because it dampens trade-offs between male and female functions. dioecy may also be selectively favored under certain environmental conditions. for example, muenchow (1987) argued that dioecy may be favored in understory habitats where nonspecific pollinators, which are often associated with dioecy, tend to be found. dioecious species have also flourished on the hawaiian islands, perhaps because dispersal among islands favors long-lived tree species with fleshy fruits, both traits that are associated with dioecy (schwander & crespi, 2009). despite these potential advantages, species richness of dioecious angiosperm clades is often lower than that of hermaphroditic sister groups (heilbuth,

(barrett, 2003). alternatively, sexual dimorphism driven by stronger sexual selection acting on males to attract pollinators can place dioecious lineages at greater risk of extinction, particularly when pollinator availability is fluctuating (vamosi & otto, 2002). indeed, a survey of the international union for conservation of nature red list of threatened species revealed that dioecious families are enriched for species at risk (vamosi & vamosi, 2005), thus hinting that dioecy is associated with elevated extinction risk, at least under present conditions. furthermore, dioecious lineages tend to exhibit a suite of correlated traits, including abiotic pollination, biotic dispersal, woody growth form, tropical distribution

underlying mechanism. in addition, sister-clade contrasts discard phylogenetic information both internal and external to the sister clades and assume only a single trait transition differentiating the two sisters (but see heilbuth, 2000). furthermore, a recent analysis demonstrated that sister-clade comparisons can be strongly biased when the derived state has fewer species because the waiting time until the derived state first appears reduces opportunities for diversification in that state (k‚Ç¨afer & mousset, 2014). notably, using a resampling test that should correct this problem, k‚Ç¨afer & mousset (2014) reanalyzed the data of heilbuth (2000) and concluded that dioecy does not lead to lower

associations, rabosky & goldberg (2015) suggested performing comparative analyses on multiple data sets, drawing conclusions based on a preponderance of evidence (mayrose et al., 2011; rolland et al., 2014). to this end, we gathered data on sexual systems in many taxonomic groups (largely genera) that contain both dioecious and nondioecious species (tree of sex consortium, 2014). in this study, we assembled molecular phylogenies for dozens of genera for which we had detailed sexual system information. this allowed us to investigate the consequences of dioecy for rates of speciation and extinction using the binary state speciation and extinction (bisse) likelihood method (maddison

this correlation (monocot feeding ~ diversification) to fundamentally different approaches of analyses (bamm, and bisse; see fig. 1b, c) lends further support to the higher diversification of monocot-feeding group. although the monocot-feeding lineage represented <20% of the lineages at the k-pg boundary (~65 mya), it includes ca. 50% of extant species. however, model comparisons indicated a possible influence of unknown factors on the estimated diversification pattern suggesting that the association between monocot-feeding and diversification rate must be influenced by certain unmeasured factors. interestingly, we found that the change to monocot feeding did not increase diversification immediately - the rate shift, a

number of tips is low, and when the tip-ratio bias (ratio of numbers of tips with different character states) is high [92]. davis et al. [92] concluded that bisse results should be inferred with extreme caution when the phylogeny included fewer than 300 terminals and/or when fewer than 10% of species are of one character state. although tip-ratio bias is unlikely to be a problem in our dataset, we acknowledge that the number of tips is a concern. however, the main result from bisse, i.e., increased diversification of monocot feeders compared to that of dicot feeders, is also corroborated sahoo et

harbor a mixture of old and recently derived lineages, whereas lowland regions should contain more derived lineages linder (2008). the second factor, edaphic heterogeneity, might be important by providing a mosaic of divergent selection pressures promoting divergence and speciation (rourke 1972; linder 2003). this hypothesis predicts that recently diverged sister species should tend to occur in different edaphic environments. third and fourth, pollinator specialization and phenological shifts might promote speciation by causing reproductive isolation among populations (johnson 1996; linder 2003). if these are frequent causes of speciation, we predict that recently diverged sister species should tend to have different pollinators or

the cape flora diversification rates net diversification rates of all four groups were calculated following equation 7 of magall√≥n and sanderson (2001) for crown groups under the assumptions of 1) no extinction (Œµ = 0) and 2) a high relative extinction rate (Œµ = 0.9) to evaluate the tempo of species diversification. furthermore, we used both temporal and topological approaches to test for shifts in diversification rates using branching times and tree topologies, respectively. first, a maximum likelihood approach (rabosky 2006b) was utilized to test whether diversification rates have changed over time, contrasting the likelihoods of the data under models with

a high probability of a type i error. thus, to obtain an estimate of the null distribution of the test statistic (Œ¥aic), we generated 1000 trees for each study group using phylogen (rambaut 2002). this simulation accommodates incomplete taxon sampling by first generating phylogenetic trees consisting of the number of species described for each group following a yule process, and subsequently sampling these trees to reconstruct phylogenies containing the same number of taxa as included in our data sets. the observed Œ¥aic value is then compared with the same statistic for the simulated trees, which provide the null distribution of the

loss of the corresponding phylogenetic information throughout the evolutionary history of the lineage (moore et al. 2004), and thus, rate shifts are interpreted as increases along the branch leading to the more diverse clade. nevertheless, we remain cautious about the interpretation of the diversification rate shifts, especially in cases where species-poor lineages are nested within more diverse clades. spatial patterns of speciation our analysis of the geographical mode of speciation showed that all groups apart from podalyrieae have intercepts significantly different from those obtained under the range randomization test. thus, present-day distributions might still contain information on the mode of speciation.

the mode of speciation. using the correlation between node ages and degree of sympatry, we infer that the geographic mode of speciation is predominantly allopatric, although extensive range movements have occurred as apparent by the wide scatter of overlap values. however, in a few cases, we found recently diverged sister species occurring in sympatry, a pattern that might reflect sympatric speciation occurring at least at low frequencies. alternatively, the high degree of range overlap observed might be due to the spatial resolution of the distribution data used in this study. the qds grid cells have an area of approximately 625 km2

of realized states in each trait, no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the causes of speciation. potential explanations for the high frequency of pollinator shifts observed in babiana could be that pollinator shifts are the result of a direct selection for reproductive isolation in secondary contact zones between sister species adapted to different soil types (goldblatt and manning 1996; van der niet et al. 2006), or that the diversity of pollination systems might in fact be the result, not the cause, of high species richness (armbruster and muchhala 2009). in conclusion, our study shows that the remarkable plant diversity in

plant - insect interactions lineage diversification rates plant defense | | downloaded by guest on march 2, 2020 e ver since the key innovation hypothesis was first proposed in the 1940s (1, 2), the origination of novel traits has been a popular yet controversial explanation for the exceptional disparity in species richness observed across clades in the tree of life. despite decades of research linking traits to diversification, we have remarkably few examples of traits that have been convincingly demonstrated to spur diversification repeatedly across independent, distantly related groups. notable exceptions include a number of ecologically important traits mediating interactions between

food rewards to arthropod bodyguards in return for protection against natural enemies (7), increase the evolutionary diversification rate of the plant lineages that participate in them. the morphological traits that mediate defense mutualisms represent well-studied examples of characters hypothesized to expand a plant's niche via interactions with mutualists and influence species success in various environmental contexts (8). although the costs and benefits of participating in defense mutualisms are well studied (9), the hypothesis that the ecological impact of defense mutualisms leaves a predictable macroevolutionary signature, increasing lineage diversification within and among clades of plants, has only been examined in a single

the indirect effect of significance plants that provide food and housing to animals in return for defense against enemies are classic examples of mutualistic partnerships in nature. here, we show that the evolution of such plant - animal mutualisms also can lead to a trajectory of accelerated accumulation of plant species in the lineages that participate in these cooperative interactions. we found that the evolution of plant organs (extrafloral nectaries) that facilitate mutualisms with animal defenders was repeatedly followed by increased rates of diversification across distantly related plant lineages. these results suggest that by enabling ecological interactions with animals, the convergent

well studied ecologically, and their only known function is defense against herbivores and microbial pathogens by attracting natural enemies (17). such features have evolved hundreds of times and occur in about a quarter of all vascular plant families (18). here, we first ask whether, across all vascular plants, families containing species with efns are associated with higher diversification rates than families without efns. we then focus in on the phylogenetic history and evolution of efns in six distantly related plant clades to evaluate whether efns are linked, directly or indirectly, to increased lineage diversification rates. as such, this study represents a

that follow, we discuss the importance of this combined explanation. we then discuss future work, which should address two major questions: (1) what ecological factors explain the evolutionary and biogeographic patterns found? (2) do results for lysimachieae apply to other plant groups in east asia? our results suggest that high species richness in east asia in lysimachieae is explained by a combination of time and relatively high diversification rates. neither variable alone explained richness patterns among regions. specifically, even though east asia has been colonized for a relatively long period of time relative to most other regions, europe and north america

by a combination of time and relatively high diversification rates. neither variable alone explained richness patterns among regions. specifically, even though east asia has been colonized for a relatively long period of time relative to most other regions, europe and north america have been colonized longer and yet are relatively species poor. therefore, based on time alone, europe and north america should have the highest richness. similarly, even though east asia has a relatively high weighted net diversification rate (much higher than europe or north america), both hawaii and africa have higher rates. however, hawaii and africa were both colonized relatively

highest richness. similarly, even though east asia has a relatively high weighted net diversification rate (much higher than europe or north america), both hawaii and africa have higher rates. however, hawaii and africa were both colonized relatively recently, and therefore their high net diversification rates have not yet yielded high species richness. overall, neither time nor diversification rates explained richness patterns among regions. yet, a weighted measure that incorporates both time and diversification rates provides a strong explanation for richness patterns among √≥ 2018 the authors new phytologist √≥ 2018 new phytologist trust new phytologist regions, especially the high richness of

the family, and that the si mechanism was not regained. for all breeding system models, we estimated a transition rate from i to c but not the reverse (qci = 0). ploidy and diversification we first employed a model (labeled m1), previously used by mayrose et al. (2011), with each species classified as diploid (d) or polyploid (p). although this model can be powerful in studies of trait evolution, it is prone to incorrectly reporting that a trait is associated with diversification differences (maddison & fitzjohn, 2015; rabosky & goldberg, 2015). we therefore define several models that incorporate additional forms of

system and diversification ploidy and breeding system might influence lineage diversification individually, but these two traits also have an intricate association (discussed in the introduction). therefore, we considered several multistate models that investigate the contribution of both traits and the allowable transitions between them. the simplest model (m16) classifies each species as either si diploid (id), sc diploid (cd) or sc polyploid (cp); recall that si polyploids do not occur. each of these states may again be associated with different rates of speciation and extinction, and the allowable transitions are loss of si within the diploid state (from id to cd),

to caetano et al., 2018; huang et al., 2018). we also fit the analogous models but allowing for diploidization (m21 - m25). breeding system and diversification we propose five breeding system models following the same logic as the ploidy models above. under the simplest breeding system and diversification model (m11), species are classified as self-incompatible (i) or self-compatible (c). this is the same model as in the analysis presented in goldberg et al.

the role of ploidy in net diversification is unclear, with marginal support for diploids having higher diversification rates, but rate differences perhaps better explained by another factor. breeding system only when considering breeding system alone (m11; fig. 2c), we found a larger net diversification rate for si than for sc species, in agreement with goldberg et al. (2010). when a hidden state is included, the large net diversification rate difference persists for one hidden state but is diminished for the other (m14; fig. 2d). in the statistical model comparisons, the best two supported models include diversification differences due to both breeding

diversification associated with breeding system persists even when ploidy is included in the model. the reverse is not true: the association of ploidy with net diversification in the simplest ploidy-only model (m1; figs 2a, s18a) appears to be driven by the subset of diploids that are si, while among sc species, net diversification rates for diploids and polyploids are similar. when a hidden state is included, the separation in net diversification rate of id vs cd and cp persists within one hidden state but is reduced in the other (m19, fig. 2f). the same general pattern remains when diploidization is included

elapsed, the one-step pathway is more likely because it only necessitates a single event to reach the sc polyploid state. when more time has elapsed, the two-step pathway is more likely because the rate of loss of si within diploids, qic, is greater than the rate of polyploidization for si species, qi (fig. s7). that is, an id lineage is more likely to begin its path to polyploidy with a transition to cd, but completing this path to cp takes longer. robertson et al.

id, means that relatively fewer lineages are available to complete the second step of the two-step pathway, ending in cp. consequently, even over long timescales, we find that the two-step pathway contributes less to the formation of polyploids (fig. 4, right panels) when considering diversification as well as transitions. discussion species are composed of vast assemblages of variable traits. many traits are both heritable and possibly affect the propensity of species to perish or multiply (lewontin, 1970). examining the effects of complex trait combinations on lineage diversification, however, remains challenging. focusing first on ploidy and then on breeding system, we found

in this family found that si may cause higher diversification rates, compared with sc (goldberg et al., 2010; fig. 2c). our analyses that include a hidden trait recover the same pattern, with one important difference. on the background of one hidden state, we recover a net diversification rate for sc species that is positive and greater than the diversification rate of si species on the background of the other hidden state (fig. 2d). therefore, sc may not be a 'dead end' when coupled with some unknown trait combinations or processes not modelled by these two traits. our analyses also reveal that

highest net diversification rate is associated with si diploids, while sc diploids have a lower diversification rate that overlaps with the net diversification of sc polyploids (fig. 2e). thus, breeding system appears to provide a relatively better explanation of diversification rate differences, with ploidy providing a secondary effect within sc species. throughout our numerous model comparisons, we find that inclusion of hidden states provides a considerably better fit (table s4). this is consistent with the expectation that many processes, beyond those associated with the focal traits, can affect inference of speciation and extinction. it is, however, unclear exactly which processes are

versa (figs s15, s16). but the strong statistical support for processes not well explained by ploidy and breeding system (table s4) tempts one to interpret the remaining variation as the effect of other measurable traits. for example, our data appear to show a rapidly diversifying australasian clade of mostly sc species within solanum, which suggests that geography may play a role. nevertheless, it is also possible that the addition of hidden states instead explains variation stemming from any of a number of unrelated processes or methodological artifacts, as previously discussed by beaulieu & o'meara (2016). in the absence of additional information,

two pathways, but future work could instead rely on stochastic character mapping to estimate the numbers of each type of transition more directly. macroevolutionary transition rates represent a combination of time spent waiting for individuals with a new character state, and for that new state to become widespread within the species. for our traits, this consists of mutations that break si or generate polyploid individuals, and selective pressures that cause fixation (or loss) of these mutants. estimates of mutation rates are highly uncertain, but the chance of breakdown of si within diploids is perhaps 10\0035 per pollen grain; this includes breakdown

the evolution of gender dimorphism as a different mechanism of inbreeding avoidance (miller & venable, 2000). a further test of this hypothesis would additionally examine the propensity of polyploids generated through either pathway to become dioecious (robertson et al., 2011). second, we might wonder whether the propensity for a polyploid species to diversify depends on whether it arose via the one-step or two-step pathway. this could be tested with a different form of a hidden state model, in which the polyploid state is subdivided into parts, reflecting the arriving path taken to that state. such an estimate of path dependence could

we included a slate of models with a diploidization parameter, and show that our main conclusions are robust to this process (fig. s18). these models also suggest modest statistical support for diploidization (table s6), although our estimates of its rate were highly uncertain. furthermore, additional lines of evidence for classifying species as diploid or polyploid (beyond the genus-level chromosome multiplicity that we primarily relied on) are needed for more reliable conclusions. other lines of evidence about the prevalence of diploidization within solanaceae or its ancestors are mixed or even conflicting. on the one hand, polyploidy may have occurred before the origin
